<p>HON 2973-7 <b>How Computers Work: Logic in Action<br>
Homework 4 - Testing Properties of Formulas in Software Algebra</b></p>
<p><b>Due</b> Monday,&nbsp; Feb 21,
10:30am (in the classroom)</p>
<p><i>Note</i>. This homework requires defining and running software on the computer.<br>
<i>Turn in</i>: Printed copy of your defintions and evidence that you ran the
defined tests using Dracula<br>
<i>Warning</i>. Some of the following exercises have been added to the online
textbook recently.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exercise 23, Chapter 3, online textbook <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/DMtools/book.pdf">http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/DMtools/book.pdf</a></li>
  <li>Exercise 24, Chapter 3, online textbook</li>
  <li>Exercise 25, Chapter 3, online textbook</li>
  <li>Exercise 26, Chapter 3, online textbook</li>
  <li>Define doublecheck properties that check to see whether the concatentation
    operation (append) preserves elements in lists supplied as operands. That
    is, any element that occurs in either of the lists <i>xs</i> and <i>ys</i>
    must also occur in the list (append <i>xs</i> <i>ys</i>), and vice versa.
    Formulate your definitions as implications. ACL2 includes all standard
    logical operators as instrinsics. For example, &quot;and&quot;,
    &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, and &quot;implies&quot; are instrinsics in
    ACL2 and have the meanings you would expect from classical logic. Another
    intrinsic that you will find useful in this exercise is
    &quot;member-equal&quot;. The formula (member-equal <i>x xs</i>) is true
    (that is, not nil) if the value <i>x</i> occurs in the list <i>xs</i>.
    Otherwise, it is false (that is, nil).</li>
