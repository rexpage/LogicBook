\section{Numbers and Numerals}
\label{sec:numbers-numerals}
Numbers are mathematical objects with certain properties,
and they come with operators, such as addition
and multiplication, that produce new numbers from numeric
operands.
Because numbers are mathematical objects, they are ephemeral.
You can't really get your hands on them.
They are figments of the imagination.

However, numbers are useful and to deal with them,
we need to write them down some way---decimal numerals, for example.
The numeral 144 stands for the number
of eggs in a dozen cartons of eggs.
The numeral 1215 stands for the number of
years between the twenty-seventh year of the reign
of Caesar Augustus and the signing of the Magna Carta.

However, things numerals like 144 and 1215 are numerals.
They are not numbers, but instead are symbols that stand for numbers,
and they are not the only symbols we use for that purpose.
The symbols CXLIV and MCCXV stand for the same two numbers.
So do the symbols $90_{16}$ and $4BF_{16}$.
The other symbols are Roman numerals and hexadecimal numerals.
The symbols 144 and 1215 are decimal numerals,
which is the representation most
people turn to when they do arithmetic.

The decimal representation is, in fact, so embedded in
our experience and practice that we often confuse
the symbol with the number.
In fact, the dictionary lists ``number'' and ``numeral'' as synonyms.
Usually, there is no harm in considering them to be the same thing,
but we are going to use numerals
to do arithmetic in a mechanized way, and we will
be careful to separate numbers as mathematical
objects from the symbols we use to represent them.
We will refer to the mathematical object as a ``number''
and to the symbol representing it as a ``numeral''.

Let's think about how we interpret a decimal numeral as a number.
Take the numeral 1215, for example.
Each digit in the numeral has a different interpretation.
The first digit is the number of thousands in the number
that 1215 stands for. The second tells us the number
of hundreds, then the tens, and finally the units.
The following formula is a way to express this interpretation.

\begin{center}
$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$
\end{center}

This formula computes a number from the individual digits
in the numeral using standard arithmetic operations
(addition, multiplication, and exponentiation).
It shows us what the individual digits in the numeral stand for,
and gives us a leg up up on figuring out other kinds of numerals.
The digits in the hexadecimal numeral have a similar meaning,
but with a different basis. Decimal numerals are based on
powers of ten, but hexadecimal numerals are based on powers of sixteen.

The system of decimal numerals calls of ten different symbols to represent digits,
and we use the symbols 0, 1, 2, \dots 9 for this purpose.
The hexadecimal system calls for sixteen different symbols,
and we use 0, 1, 2, \dots 9, A, B, C, D, E, F to represent them.
The digits stand for the customary numbers (0 for zero, 2 for two,
and so on). The letters stand for the numbers beyond nine.

There are no conventional squiggles for digits beyond 9.
The letters A, B, \dots F were chosen for this purpose arbitrarily.
So, in hexadecimal notation, ``A'' stands for ten, ``B'' for eleven,
and so on up to ``F'' for fifteen. That leads to the following
formula to express the meaning of the hexadecimal numeral $4BF_{16}$.
(Remember, B stands for 11, F for 15.)
\begin{center}
$4 \times 16^2 + 11 \times 16^1 + 15 \times 16^0$
\end{center}

\begin{aside}
Perhaps you noticed a subtle confusion in the formulas we use
to explain the meaning of numerals. At first, we claim that
1215 is merely a symbol standing for a mathematical object.
And, we claim that the digit 2 is merely a symbol standing
for the number of items in a pair, along with similar
claims for the digits 1 and 5. Then, we use those symbols
in the formula $1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$
as if they were numbers.

There is some slight of hand going on here.
We are trapped by our terminology.
Numbers as mathematical objects are figments of our imagination,
but when we write formulas, we have to choose some symbols to
represent them.
So, in the formula $1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$,
we use the symbols 1, 10, 3, 2, 5, and 0 as if they were numbers.
But, in the numeral 1215, the symbols 1, 2, and 5 are not numbers.
They are symbols standing for numbers.

It's even worse with the hexadecimal numeral $4BF_{16}$
and the formula $4 \times 16^2 + 11 \times 16^1 + 15 \times 16^0$.
In the formula we have rewritten the symbol ``B'' as the decimal numeral 11
and the symbol ``F'' as the decimal numeral 15.
And, we've had the temerity to pretend that symbols
in the formula are numbers when they are really decimal numerals,
just as we did in the formula that was supposed to explain
the meaning of the decimal numeral 1215.

Furthermore, we've really mixed things up in the numeral
$4BF_{16}$ because the ``4BF'' part is in hexadecimal notation
and the ``16'' part is a decimal numeral indicating that we are
to interpret the digits in base sixteen rather than the conventional base ten.

Try to get your head around this slight of hand.
We're more-or-less stuck with it. Figments of our imagination have
to be materialized, somehow, if we are going to talk about them.
\caption{Digits as Numbers}
\label{aside-digits-as-numbers}
\end{aside}

%okay to here

Formulas like $1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$
convert numerals to numbers.
No doubt you could use this example to construct the appropriate formula
for any given numeral. Base 10 numerals for sure, and hex numerals, too,
and probably any other base.

We'll say more about to converting numerals to numbers later,
but what about going the other direction, converting
numbers to numerals?
Suppose someone gives you an operator that is supposed to
mechanize the conversion of a number to a decimal numeral.
The name of the operator is ``dgts'', so the formula
``(dgts 1215)'' would deliver the sequence ``[5 1 2 1]''.
That is, dgts delivers a list of the decimal digits.
The digits are in reverse order in the list,
but they are the right digits.

\begin{aside}
\emph{What! The function delivers the digits backwards! Why is that?}

Of course, the function could have delivered the digits in the
customary order, but we have a reason for encoding the numeral
backwards in the sequence that we are using to represent it.
The reason will become apparent soon, but for now, just get used
to it. We write numerals like ``1215'' in the usual way, but
the dgts function delivers them in the form of
a sequence ``[5 1 2 1]'' in which the digits appear in the
reverse order.

Besides being backwards, the elements in the sequence are numbers,
not symbolic digits.
That is another part of our slight of hand.
We are using numbers to represent the digit symbols.
We could convert them to pure symbols,
but at this point, we are better off leaving them in the form of numbers
because we will want to use them as numbers later.

By the way, the sequence notation ``[5 1 2 1]'' is the symbol we use
to describe the sequence, but the sequence itself is another kind of mathematical object.
That is, it's another figment of our imagination.
The ``real'' object is ephemeral in the same sense as numbers.
\caption{Numerals as Sequences \dots Backwards}
\label{numeral-as-sequence}
\end{aside}

Before you make heavy use of the operator, you will want to check it out.
You might try it on a few numbers, for a start.
\begin{Verbatim}
(check-expect (dgts 1215) '(5 1 2 1))
(check-expect (dgts 1964) '(4 6 9 1))
(check-expect (dgts 12345) '(5 4 3 2 1))
(check-expect (dgts 0) '())
\end{Verbatim}

Wait a minute!
Why does (dgts 0) deliver the empty sequence instead of ``[0]''?
That's another little trick.
Besides delivering the digits in reverse order, leading zeros are always omitted.
We could write the numeral ``1964'' with as many leading zeros as we like.
The numerals ``01964'' and ``000001964'' also stand for the number 1964.
Those numerals would be ``[4 6 9 1 0]'' and ``[4 6 9 1 0 0 0 0 0]'' in
the reverse order that the dgts operator delivers.

However, dgts never includes any leading zeros in the numerals it delivers.
It leaves them all off, even for the number zero.
That's why (dgts 0) is nil.
Of course (dgts 012345) would be the same as (dgts 12345), too,
because ``012345'' and ``12345'' stand for the same number.
Both of those formulas would deliver the sequence ``[5 4 3 2 1]''.
Remember: dgts operates on numbers, not numerals.

%okay to here

The computer interprets the decimal numeral in the formula (dgts 012345)
as a number and converts it to a mathematical object. That is, a number.
What does that number look like? None of your business.
That's the computer's business.
It has it's own way of dealing with numbers.
Later, we'll study the way most computers do this,
but for now we will assume that the computer has some way of turning
numerals into whatever form it uses to deal with numbers.

Now that we've run a few sanity checks, we want to get down to some serious testing.
That means big batches of automated tests on random data.
Coming up with automated tests calls for a little more thought.
Let's start small. How about the last digit in a decimal numeral?
What mathematical formula would deliver the last digit in a
decimal numeral, given an arbitrary, positive integer $n$?

The last digit in a decimal numeral is the remainder when you divide
the number by ten. The formula that converts a numeral to a number
makes that clear.
\begin{center}
$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$
\end{center}

Each of the terms in the formula is a product of a power
of ten with another number. A power of ten is, of course,
a multiple of ten, so none of the terms contribute to the remainder
when dividing by ten. None of them, that is, except the last one.
It does not have a factor of ten in it because the ten is raised to the
power zero, and anything to the power zero is one, which is not a multiple of ten.
So, to get the last digit in the numeral, all we need to do is to
compute the remainder in the division of the number by ten.

\begin{aside}
To get this all straight,
transport yourself back the the third grade.
In those days, when you learned long division,
there were four parts to the problem,
and they all had names.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\emph{divisor}   & number you divide by \\
\emph{dividend}  & number you divide by the divisor \\
\emph{quotient}  & what you get when you do the division \\
\emph{remainder} & what's left over to make up the difference
\end{tabular}
\caption{Think Third-Grade Division}
\label{third-grade-division}
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
ACL2 will not admit a function into its logic world unless
it can prove that the function always delivers a value in
a finite number of computational steps.
This is because functions that don't terminate complicate the reasoning process.
Proving that the dgts function, which converts numbers to numerals,
terminates for all inputs requires an understanding of modular arithmetic.
Fortunately, someone has put together a package of theorems on that topic.
They reside in the ``arithmetic-3/floor-mod/floor-mod'' book
(page \pageref{floor-mod-include-book}).
ACL2 will admit the definition of dgts when those theorems
have been included in its logic world.
\caption{Termination, ACL2 Admit, and Floor/Mod Equations}
\label{admit-def}
\label{floor-mod-book}
\end{aside}

The remainder is
what the ``mod'' function delivers (page \pageref{mod-function}).
The following formula uses mod to make sure the last digit in the numeral
that the dgts operator delivers for the number $n$ is correct.
\begin{Verbatim}
(= (first (dgts n)) (mod n 10))
\end{Verbatim}

Since dgts delivers the digits backwards,
``(first (dgts $n$))'', the first digit in the sequence,
is the last digit in the numeral.
The formulas checks to make sure that digit is ``(mod $n$ 10)'',
the remainder when dividing $n$ by 10.

We can use the doublecheck facility of Proof Pad or Dracula to run this test on a batch of random numbers.
We need to be careful not to allow zero to pop up in the testing
because (dgts 0) is nil, so there is no first digit to check.
Besides, we've already completed the testing of (dgts 0) in our sanity checks.
We can avoid retesting zero by adding one to a random natural number.
That produces a random, non-zero, positive integer.
\begin{Verbatim}
(defproperty dgts-last-digit-tst
  (n-minus-1 :value (random-natural))
  (let* ((n (+ n-minus-1 1))) ; avoid zero (no digits in numeral)
    (= (first (dgts n))
       (mod n 10))))
\end{Verbatim}

That takes care of testing the last digit
(that is, the units digit), but what about the others?
We can do something about those by observing that the quotient,
when $n$ is divided by 10,
is a number with the same digits as $n$,
except that the last digit is missing.
Remember, we're doing third-grade arithmetic here.
The quotient is the main result of the division.
No fraction, no decimal point, no remainder. Just the whole-number quotient.
Since we've already tested to make sure the last digit is correct,
we don't need to worry about that.
We only need to worry about the other digits.

%okay to here

One way to test the other digits is to apply dgts to the quotient.
The intrinsic function ``floor'' (page \pageref{floor-def})
produces the quotient (discarding the remainder).

The following formula implements the test we have in mind.
It checks to make sure the digits other than the units digit
in the sequence dgts delivers for $n$
are the same as the digits in the sequence
dgts delivers for the quotient in $(n \div 10)$.
\begin{Verbatim}
(equal (rest (dgts n))       ; all digits except the units digit
       (dgts (floor n 10)))) ; digits of the quotient
\end{Verbatim}

As with the test of the units digit,
we can run a batch of tests based on our rest-of-the-digits
observation by defining a doublecheck property.
\begin{Verbatim}
(defproperty dgts-other-digits-tst
  (n-minus-1 :value (random-natural))
  (let* ((n (+ n-minus-1 1))) ; avoid zero (empty numeral)
    (equal (rest (dgts n))
           (dgts (floor n 10)))))
\end{Verbatim}

It would be nice to run these tests, but ``dgts'' is not an intrinsic operator.
We have to provide a definition for it.
To do that we use the ``defun'' command, which is similar to defproperty,
but without any value specifications. The definition will be inductive,
of course, using the same ideas as the tests,
and will follow the three C's of Figure~\ref{fig:inductive-def-keys}
(page \pageref{fig:inductive-def-keys}), which we repeat here,
in a form tailored to the dgts function.
\begin{samepage}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{3.5in}}
\emph{Complete}      & Two cases: the number is zero or it isn't. So, two formulas.\\
\emph{Consistent}    & The cases do not overlap---no chance for inconsistency.\\
\emph{Computational} & In the inductive case (when $n$ is not zero), the argument of
                       ``dgts'' is divided by ten, which makes it closer to zero
                       (the non-inductive case).
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{samepage}

The definition takes the following form.
\label{dgts-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun dgts (n)
  (if (zp n)
      nil                          ; {dgts0}
      (cons (mod n 10)             ; {dgts1}
            (dgts (floor n 10)))))
\end{Verbatim}

This definition uses the operator, ``zp'' (page \pageref{zp-def}).
The formula (zp $n$) delivers true if $n$ is the natural number zero
(or, if it isn't a natural number at all), and false otherwise.

\begin{aside}
The function ``zp'' is used to test for zero
in the domain of natural numbers.
In the ACL2 logic, the formula (zp $n$) has the value true if $n$ is zero,
or if $n$ is not a natural number.
That makes zp the operator normally chosen to select
the non-inductive case in inductive definitions of functions.

You might think a comparison with zero using the ``='' operator
would work equally well, but it doesn't.
For example, the formula (= $n$ 0) would have the
value false if $n$ were 3/2.
However, if fractions are outside the
intended domain of a function being defined,
then something needs to be done to make the
computation terminate when a fraction pops up,
perhaps unintentionally, as argument in a formula referring to the function.
Usually, the most desirable choice is to select
a non-inductive case in the definition of the function,
and zp makes that easy to do.

The function ``posp'' (page \pageref{posp-def})
is also useful in inductive definitions
that with arguments that are expected to be natural numbers.
The formula (posp $n$) is true if $n$ is a non-zero natural number.
\caption{Natural Number Tests: Zero (zp) and Non-Zero (posp)}
\label{zp-def}
\end{aside}

If you put the definition of dgts at the beginning of a program
and import the ``testing'' and ``doublecheck" facilities, you
can enter the tests and run them using Proof Pad or Dracula.
You can also enter formulas in the command panel to compute
decimal numerals for any natural numbers you choose.

\section{Numbers from Numerals}
\label{sec:numbers-from-numerals}
The ``dgts'' function (page \pageref{dgts-defun})
provides a way to produce a decimal
numeral, given a number. How about going in the other direction?
Given a decimal numeral, produce the corresponding number.
You already know that the formulas look like these:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{center}
$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0$ --- for 1215 \\
$1 \times 10^2 + 4 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0$ --- for 144
\end{center}
\end{samepage}

%okay to here

But, let's think of properties instead of complicated formulas.
What properties would a function
converting decimal numerals to numbers have?
Since the dgts function produces numerals represented as sequences
of decimal digits (numbers in the range 0 to 9),
and in the reverse of the usual order
(that is, with the units digit first,
then the tens digit, then hundreds, and so on),
let's assume that numerals will take that form.

Let's call the function that converts decimal numerals to numbers  ``nmb10''.
We know that (nmb10 nil) must be zero because (dgts 0) delivers
zero, and we are trying to convert numerals produced by dgts
back the the numbers they came from.
How about a one-digit numeral $[x_0]$.
The equation in that case would be (nmb10 [$x_0$]) = $x_0$.

If there are two or more digits, the numeral would take the form
[$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n+1}$].
Then, the equation would be
\begin{center}
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]) =
$(x_0 + x_1 \times 10^1 + x_2 \times 10^2 + \dots x_{n+1} \times 10^{n+1})$
\end{center}

%okay to here

Since all of the terms in the sum
include a factor of ten, except the first term,
we can factor ten out of all of the terms beyond the first.
Factoring the formula in this way produces a new equation.
\begin{center}
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]) = $(x_0 + 10 \times (x_1 \times 10^0 + x_2 \times 10^1 + \dots x_n \times 10^n))$
\end{center}

%okay to here

But, the sequence [$x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$] is also a decimal numeral.
And, the value is stands for is
$(x_1 \times 10^0 + x_2 \times 10^1 + \dots x_n \times 10^n)$,
which is the value nmb10 should deliver, given the numeral [$x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$].
That is, the following equation holds.
\begin{center}
(nmb10 [$x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]) = $(x_1 + x_2 \times 10^1 + \dots x_{n+1} \times 10^n)$
\end{center}

%okay to here

Observe that this formula for (nmb10 $(x_1 x_2 \dots x_{n+1})$) is identical
to the factor multiplied by ten in the previous equation.
Therefore, we can rewrite that equation as follows.
\begin{center}
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]) = ($x_0 + 10 \times$ (nmb10 [$x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]))
\end{center}

Now, we have an inductive equation that delivers the right value for
numerals with two or more digits. Furthermore, the same formula works
for one-digit numerals because (nmb10 nil) is zero.
\begin{center}
(nmb10 [$x_0$]) = ($x_0 + 10 \times$ (nmb10 nil))
\end{center}

We now have one equation that covers all numerals with one or more digits.
Furthermore, we know by the \{cons\} axiom
(page \pageref{cons-axiom-informal}):
\begin{center}
[$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$] = (cons $x_0$ $[x_1 \dots x_n]$)
\end{center}

Therefore, by the axioms relating the functions
first, rest, and cons
(page \pageref{first-rest-cons}),
we arrive at the following equations.

\begin{samepage}
\begin{center}
$x_0$ = (first [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$]) % \\ to end line causes error here
\end{center}                                % using end center/begin center works, but puts in blank line
\begin{center}
[$x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$] = (rest [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$])
\end{center}
\end{samepage}

%no error above this point

This, along with using $xs$
as a shorthand for [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ \dots $x_{n}$]
allows us to rewrite the equation
for non-empty numerals in prefix notation as follows.
\begin{center}
(nmb10 $xs$) = (+ (first $xs$) ($*$ 10 (nmb10 (rest $xs$))))
\end{center}

Now we have the basis to apply the rule of the three C's
(page \pageref{fig:inductive-def-keys}) to define nmb10.

%error above this point

\label{nmb10-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun nmb10 (xs)
  (if (consp xs)
      (+ (first xs)               ; {n10.1}
         (* 10 (nmb10 (rest xs))))
      0))                         ; {n10.0}
\end{Verbatim}

We have derived this definition carefully,
from things we know about numbers,
but let's try to use logic to be sure we got it right.
We want to prove that
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$])
delivers the same number as the formula
$(x_0 + x_1 \times 10^1 + x_2 \times 10^2 + \dots x_{n} \times 10^{n})$.
\begin{samepage}
\label{horner10-thm}
\begin{center}
Theorem \{\emph{Horner 10}\} \\
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$]) =
$x_0 + x_1 \times 10^1 + x_2 \times 10^2 + \dots x_{n} \times 10^{n}$
\end{center}
\end{samepage}

Theorem \{\emph{Horner 10}\} states that the function nmb10
computes a sum of multiples of successive powers of ten.
The multipliers (known as ``coefficients'') of the powers
of ten are the digits in a decimal numeral.
We call it the theorem ``\emph{Horner 10}'' because
the scheme it uses to carry out the computation is
known as ``Horner's rule''.

Proving Theorem \{\emph{Horner 10}\} amounts to
verifying that $(\forall n.P(n))$ is true,
where the predicate $P$ is defined as follows.
Of course the natural numbers are the universe of discourse for $P$.
\begin{center}
$P(n) \equiv$
((nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$]) =
$(x_0 + x_1 \times 10^1 + x_2 \times 10^2 + \dots x_{n} \times 10^{n}))$
\end{center}

Proceeding by mathematical induction,
we first prove that $P(0)$ is true.

Now, we prove that $P(n+1)$ is true,
and because we cite mathematical induction,
we can assume that $P(n)$ is true.
In the last step, we do some standard
calculation in numeric algebra (in prefix notation)
using the distributive law.
We cite ``algebra'' to justify that step in the proof.
Generally, we will take advantage of the ordinary
laws of algebra when we need them in numeric formulas.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
 & $P(n+1) \equiv$
((nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n+1}$]) =

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Since we proved that $P(0)$ is true and that
$P(n) \rightarrow P(n+1)$ is true if $P(n)$,
regardless of what natural number $n$ stands for,
we conclude by mathematical induction that
$P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n$.
In other words, the formula
(nmb10 [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$]) delivers the correct
number whenever [$x_0$ $x_1$ \dots $x_{n}$] is a decimal numeral
represented as a list, starting with the units digit
and proceeding, power of ten by power of ten, up to the high-order digit.

We derived this theorem from the axioms defining the nmb10 function.
Besides the axioms, our reasoning cited equations we proved before
(or knew from numeric algebra),
along with the deductive inference rule ``mathematical induction.''
We would also like to know that the axioms defining the dgts function
produces the correct numeral.
Since we know that nmb10 delivers the correct number,
given a decimal numeral, we can confirm the correctness
of (dgts $n$) by proving the following theorem.
\begin{center}
\label{dgts-ok}
Theorem \{\emph{dgts-ok}\} \\
(nmb10 (dgts $n$)) = $n$
\end{center}

In other words, we want to prove that
$(\forall n.D(n))$ is true, where D($n$) stands the following proposition.
\begin{center}
$D(n) \equiv$ ((nmb10 (dgts $n$)) $= n$)
\end{center}

Since the universe of discourse
for the predicate $D$ is the natural number,
we may as well try to use mathematical induction
to prove that $(\forall n.D(n))$ is true.
That requires a proof of $D(0)$ and
a proof of $(\forall n.(D(n) \rightarrow D(n+1)))$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    & $D(0) \equiv$ ((nmb10 (dgts $0$)) = $0$) & \\
    \hline
    & (nmb10 (dgts $0$)) & \\

$=$ & 0                  & \{\emph{n10.0}\} (page \pageref{nmb10-defun}) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    & $D(n+1) \equiv$ ((nmb10 (dgts (+ $n$ 1))) = (+ $n$ 1)) & \\
    \hline
    & (nmb10 (dgts (+ $n$ 1)))           & \\
$=$ & (nmb10 (cons (mod (+ $n$ 1) 10) (dgts (floor (+ $n$ 1) 10)))  & \{\emph{dgts1}\} (page \pageref{dgts-defun})\\

    &            & (page \pageref{third-grade-division})
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If you were paying very close attention,
you may have noticed that we our proof of $D(n) \rightarrow D(n+1)$
was not according to Hoyle.
To prove this implication, we need to prove that $D(n+1)$ is true whenever $D(n)$ is true.
That means we can cite $D(n)$ to justify any step in our proof of $D(n+1)$.
However, instead of citing $D(n)$, we cited $D$(floor (+ $n$ 1) 10).
That's a different proposition,
but it happens that (floor (+ $n$ 1) 10) is strictly smaller than $(n+1)$.

In this proof, we are relying on a more general inference rule
than ordinary mathematical induction.
The more general rule, which is called ``strong induction''
is equivalent to ordinary mathematical induction.
That is, one can verify that if the rule of ordinary mathematical induction
is a valid rule of inference, then so is strong induction, and vice versa.
The proof is not difficult, but it's a distraction,
so we are just going to assume that strong induction works.
You can summon a rationale for strong along the lines
of the rationale we had for ordinary induction (page \pageref{induction-rationale}).

\label{strong-induction-rationale}
The rationale goes like this.
Imagine that you are proving the propositions
$P(0)$, $P(1)$, $P(2)$, \dots and so on,
one by one, in sequence.
When you get to the point where you want to prove $P(n+1)$,
you will have already proven all of the propositions
with smaller indices---that is
$P(0)$, $P(1)$, $P(2)$, \dots $P(n)$.
So, in the proof of $P(n+1)$, you would be able to
cite any of the previous propositions, not just $P(n)$.
When you cite $P(n)$, but not propositions with smaller indices,
in the proof of $P(n+1)$, you are doing a proof by ordinary mathematical induction.
When you cite one or more propositions with indices smaller than $n$,
you are doing a proof by strong induction.

Since ordinary mathematical induction and strong induction are
equivalent rules of inference, we are going to refer to both of
them the same way. We'll just call it mathematical induction.
But, the formal statement of the strong induction rule
is different from the formal statement of ordinary induction
(Figure~\ref{induction-rule}, page \pageref{induction-rule}).
The strong induction rule is state formally in
Figure~\ref{strong-induction-rule} (page \pageref{strong-induction-rule}).

From now on, when we cite the mathematical induction rule of inference,
we will mean this new, strong induction rule.
After all, it encompasses the ordinary induction rule
as a special case, anyway, since it only cites $P(n)$ is the proof
of $P(n+1)$, and not any proposition in the predicate $P$ with a smaller index.
So, we may as well cite strong induction, even when we're only relying
on the ordinary induction rule.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
Prove $(\forall m<n.P(m))\rightarrow P(n)$ \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Mathematical Induction (strong induction version)}
\label{strong-induction-rule}
\end{figure}

\begin{aside}
The inference rule for ordinary mathematical induction
(Figure~\ref{induction-rule}, page \pageref{induction-rule})
requires two proofs above the line:
(1)~Prove $P(0)$ and (2)~Prove $\forall$$n$.(P($n$)$\rightarrow$P($n+1$)).
The strong induction rule
(Figure~\ref{strong-induction-rule})
calls for only one proof:
Prove $(\forall m<n.P(m))\rightarrow P(n)$.
However, when $n = 0$, this is
$(\forall m<0.P(m))\rightarrow P(0)$.
Since there 
are no natural numbers less than zero,
$(\forall m<0.P(m))$ true because
a $\forall$ quantification with an empty universe of discourse 
is true, by default
(page \pageref{empty-forall}).

So, proving $(\forall m<0.P(m))\rightarrow P(0)$
is the same as proving $True \rightarrow P(0)$,
which is equivalent to proving $P(0)$, 
just as in ordinary induction.
In other words, in strong induction there are really two proofs to do,
one for $P(0)$ and one for $(\forall m<n.P(m))\rightarrow P(n)$
when $n$ is not zero, which is usually expressed in the
equivalent form $(\forall m<n+1.P(m))\rightarrow P(n+1)$.
Looking at it this way makes a proof citing strong induction look like
a proof citing ordinary mathematical induction except that
in the proof of $P(n+1)$, all of the propositions 
$P(0)$, $P(1)$, $P(2) \dots P(n)$
are regarded as known facts, not just $P(n)$.

\section{Binary Numerals}
\label{sec:binary-numerals}

Digital circuits, since they are a materialization of mathematical logic,
have components that can represent two different values.
We call them zero and one, and we choose those names primarily
because circuits that deal with numbers do so in terms of binary numerals.
Decimal numerals require ten different symbols (0, 1, 2, \dots 9)
to represent digits.

Binary numerals only need two (0 and 1) for their binary digits,
which are usually called ``bits'', and that makes them well-suited
for representation in the form of digital circuits.
We will be discussing the design and analysis of circuits to do
arithmetic in terms of binary numerals, so we will need to know
how to construct and interpret them.

Decimal numerals represent numbers as sums of multiples of powers of ten.
Binary numerals are similar, but use two as a basis instead of ten.
So, the binary numeral with bits $x_nx_{n-1}\dots x_2x_1x_0$ stands for the number
$(x_0 + x_1 \times 2^1 + x_2 \times 2^2 + \dots + x_{n-1} \times 2^{n-1} x_{n} \times 2^{n})$.
The only differences between this formula and the one that interprets
decimal numerals is that it has powers of two where the decimal formula had
powers of ten, and multipliers are bits (0, 1) instead of
digits (0, 1, 2, \dots 9).

Therefore, we can convert the functions for decimal numerals to binary
by simply changing the base from ten to two.
The following definitions of the functions ``bits'' and ``nmb''
to construct and interpret binary numerals come directly
from that observation.
Like the corresponding functions for decimal numerals
(dgts, \pageref{dgts-defun}, and nmb10, \pageref{nmb10-defun}),
bits and nmb use the function zp (page \pageref{zp-def}) to choose
between the base case ($n = 0$) and the inductive case ($n > 0$).
Also, ACL2 needs access to the theorems
in the floor-mod book (page \pageref{floor-mod-book})
to admit the function ``bits'' to its logic,
just as in the definition of dgts (\pageref{dgts-defun}).

\label{bits-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun bits (n)
  (if (zp n)
      nil                         ; {bits0}
      (cons (mod n 2)             ; {bits1}
            (bits (floor n 2)))))
\end{Verbatim}
\label{nmb-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun nmb (xs)
  (if (consp xs)
      (+ (first xs) (* 2 (nmb (rest xs)))) ; {nmb1}
      0))                                  ; {nmb0}
\end{Verbatim}

The theorem for correctness of the function nmb that interprets
binary numeral as numbers and the theorem about the function nmb
being the inverse of the function bits are
also true in the new context, and the proofs are similar to the ones
on decimal numerals presented earlier in this chapter.
Constructing those proofs is a good exercise.
It will help you understand decimal numerals better,
and clarify your understanding of binary numerals.

\Exercise We created the definitions of bits and nmb
by copying those of dgts and nmb10, and changing the twos to tens.
The practice of defining new entities by copying
old ones and making a few changes is
the single most common cause of errors in computer software (page \pageref{abstraction}).
Instead, we should have done is to define new functions with
an additional parameter for the base to deal with positional
numerals with any base.

Make new definitions of the functions dgts, nmb10, bits, and nmb
that rely on the abstraction of the base in
the functions numeral-from-number and number-from-numeral.

\Exercise In a manner similar to that suggested in the previous exercise,
       define functions to convert
       between numbers and hexadecimal (base 16) numerals.

\Exercise The hexadecimal numerals in the previous exercise
       use numbers between zero and fifteen to represent
       hexadecimal digits. Define new functions that use,
       instead, strings of characters from the set
       {0, 1, 2, \dots, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F} to represent
       hexadecimal numerals.
       While you're at it, represent the numerals as string
       in the usual ordering from high-order hexadecimal digit to
       low-order, instead of the reverse order we have been using.
       You may refer to the functions defined below that convert

%no error above this point

\begin{aside}
The definition of pad also makes use of the ``let*'' formula,
which makes it possible to give names to values
to be used within the scope of the ``let*'' formula.
A ``let*'' formula starts with the the keyword ``let*'',
then a list of name-value pairings, and finally
a formula for the value to be delivered by the ``let*''.
Each pairing is list of two elements: first a name,
then a formula specifying a value to be associated with the name.
In this example, there is only one such pairing,
but there can be any number of pairings.
The most common use of ``let*'' is to give names
to values needed more than once in a computation,
but sometimes it's used just to give mnemonic names
to significant elements in a computational formula.

\section{Numerals for Negative Numbers}
\label{sec:negative-numerals}

So far, all the numerals we've seen have represented positive numbers.
Now, we need to attend to the issue of negative numbers.
There are many ways to do that,
but a format known as ``twos complement'' stands out
because computer hardware designers have adopted it
as the standard way of dealing with negative numbers.

The twos complement approach limits numbers to a range that runs
from a specific negative limit to a specific positive limit.
Then, for negative numbers, it uses binary numerals that would
normally stand for numbers beyond the limit on the positive side.
The idea relies on properties of modular arithmetic
(page \pageref{modular-arithmetic}).

The modulus chosen for a twos-complement representation
is always a power of two. Call it $2^w$.
It happens that binary numerals for numbers in the range 0, 1, $\dots (2^{w-1}-1)$
have no more than $(w-1)$ bits (Theorem \{\emph{len-bits}$\le$\}, page \pageref{len-bitsLE}).
So, the
If the hardware allocates $w$ bits for recording binary numerals,
numbers in the range 0, 1, $\dots (2^{w-1}-1)$ will
only need $w-1$ of those bits.
They will always have a leading zero in the high-order bit.
Bit-patterns with a one in the high-order bit can be used for negative numbers.
That's where the twos complement trick comes into play.
Let's see how it works.

The number of bits that the hardware allocates for recording binary numerals
is known as the ``word size'' of the computer.
A computer with 32-bit words has circuits to deal with numbers
in the range $-2^{31}, \dots -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots 2^{31}-1$.
In the positive part of the range, it represents numbers as
ordinary binary numerals, but with enough leading zeros
to fill the 32-bit word.

For a number ($-n$) in the negative part of the range,
the twos-complement system uses the binary numeral
for ($2^{32}-n$) to represent ($-n$).
Since ($-n$) is in the negative range,
$-2^{31} \le -n < 0$.
Therefore, $2^{31} \le 2^{32}-n < 2^{32}$.
That means the twos-complement, binary numeral
that stands for the negative number ($-n$)
has exactly 32 bits (Theorem \{\emph{len-bits}\}, page \pageref{len-bits}),
the high-order bit being a 1
(Theorem \{\emph{hi-1}\}, page \pageref{hi-1}).

Modular arithmetic makes the numerals chosen
for negative numbers act like the negative numbers they stand for.
For negative numbers ($-n$) in the range $-2^{31} \le -n < 0$,
the value of (($-n$) mod $2^{32}$) is ($2^{32}-n$).
Therefore, since addition and subtraction produce consistent
results in modular arithmetic (page \pageref{modular-arithmetic}),
it follows that
  ($(m+(-n))$ mod $2^{32}$
= ((($m$) mod $2^{32}$) + ($(-n)$ mod $2^{32}$)) mod $2^{32}$
= ((($m$ mod $2^{32}$) + $(2^{32} - n)$)) mod $2^{32}$.

That is, adding the numbers represented by twos-complement
numerals, including numbers in the negative range,
is just like adding ordinary numbers, but using modular arithmetic.
Subtraction is handled by negating a number
(that is, computing the twos-complement representation
of its negative), then performing addition modulo $2^{32}$.

The same thing works for any other word size.
With word size $w$, the twos complement system
handles addition and subtraction, modulo $2^w$, for numbers
in the range $-2^{w-1}, \dots -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots 2^{w-1}-1$.
Circuits for performing addition (and subtraction, since
it is the same operation in a twos-complement system)
take advantage of these mathematical facts.
We will make use of this to design circuits to perform addition.

In summary, the twos-complement representation for computers with
word size $w$ applies to numbers in the range
$-2^{w-1}, \dots -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots 2^{w-1}-1$.
We will refer to this set of integers as $I(w)$.
\label{def-Iw}
\begin{center}
$I(w) = \{-2^{w-1}, \dots -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots 2^{w-1}-1\}$
\end{center}

We will discuss the design of a digital circuit that
performs addition on numbers in $I(w)$.
That circuit will be capable computing the sum $x+y$
if $x$, $y$, and $x+y$ are numbers in the set $I(w)$.
That circuit will use twos-complement
representation for numbers in $I(w)$.

\label{2s-def}
The \emph{twos-complement representation} for a negative number ($-n$) in $I(w)$
is the binary numeral for the number ($2^w-n$).
Twos-complement numerals for numbers in the negative range
have exactly $w$ bits, with a one-bit in the high-order slot.
That is because (len (bits (- (expt $2 w$) ($n$)))) $= w$,
since $2^{w-1} \le 2^w - n < 2^{w}$
(Theorem \{\emph{len-bits}\}, page \pageref{len-bits}).

The twos-complement representation for numbers in the positive range of $I(w)$
take the form of ordinary binary numerals, except that in
hardware they are padded with enough leading zeros
to fill out a $w$-bit word, where $w$ is the word size of the computer.
This is necessary because all of the bits in a circuit, at any point in time,
stand for either zero or one. There is no other possible state.
So, the high-order bits in a $w$-bit word containing the twos-complement
representation of a positive number are padded out with enough
leading zeros to make $w$ bits in all, but without changing the number
that the numeral stands for.

\label{twos-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun twos (w n) ; w (word size): natural number
  (if (< n 0)     ; n: integer, -2^(w-1) <= n < 2^(w-1)
      (bits (+ (expt 2 w) n)) ; {2s-}
      (pad w 0 (bits n))))    ; {2s+}
\end{Verbatim}

There will always be some padding for numerals representing
numbers in the positive range because such a number $n$
lies within the limits $0 \le n < 2^{w-1}$.
The twos-complement numeral for a value, $n$, in that range is (bits $n$),
and $0 \le $(len (bits $n$)) $< w$
(Theorem \{\emph{len-bits}$\le$\}, page \pageref{len-bitsLE}).
Figure Figure~\ref{fig:2s-comp-3bit} displays
twos-complement representations for the numbers in the set $I(3)$.
Of course, the table in the figure is only for purposes of illustration.
The word-size 3 is ridiculously small.
No computer would have words that short.

Now, here is an interesting little trick.
Suppose $n$ is a natural number in the range
$1 \le n \le 2^{31}$.
By definition (page \pageref{twos-defun}),
the twos-complement numeral for the negation of $n$,
$(-n)$, is the binary numeral for $2^{32} - n$.
That method produces the twos-complement numeral from the number.
But, there is also a way to compute this numeral for $(-n)$
directly from the numeral for $n$ by inverting its bits
(that is, changing all the zeros to ones and all the ones to zeros)
and then computing the binary numeral for the number that is
one more than the number that the numeral with inverted bits stands for.

It works like this. Let $x_{w-1}x_{w-2} \dots x_2x_1x_0$
be the $w$-bit, binary numeral for $n$, padded with leading
zeros if necessary to fill out the full $w$ bits.
In other words [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{w-2}$ $x_{w-1}$] = (twos $n$).
Then, the twos-complement numeral for $(-n)$ can be computed
by inverting the bits in (twos $n$),
interpreting the inverted-bit numeral as a number,
increasing that number by one,
then converting the new number to a binary numeral.
That may seem a bit indirect,
but when a circuit to do arithmetic on numerals is available,
inverting the bits and incrementing by one
is an attractive way to proceed.
Figure~\ref{fig:2s-comp-negation} (page \pageref{fig:2s-comp-negation})
explains why this trick works.
