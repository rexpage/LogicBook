 Most of the time I do not read my talks SEMISTOP I plan the main points
 and then speak off the top of my head STOP For this talk I need to stick
 to a text and for good cause STOP Please bear with me STOP
 I think you know what a man is STOP A woman is more or less like a man
 but not of the same sex STOP This may seem like a strange thing for me
 to start with but soon you will see why STOP Next I shall say that a
 person is a woman or a man young or old STOP

 To keep things short when
 I say  he  I mean  he or she  and when I say  his  I mean  his or her STOP 
 A machine is a thing that can do a task with no help or not much help from
 a person STOP As a rule we can speak of two or more of a thing if we add n 
 s  or  z  sound to the end of a word that names it STOP These are names of
 persons COLON  Alan Turing Alonzo Church Charles Kay Ogden Christopher Alexander
 Eric Raymond Fred Brooks John Horton Conway James Gosling Bill Joy and
 Dick Gabriel STOP The word other means  not the same STOP  The phrase other
 than means  not the same as STOP  A number may be nought or may be one more
 than a number STOP In this way we have a set of numbers with no bound STOP
 There are other numbers as well but I shall not speak more of them yet
 STOP These numbers nought or one more than a number can be used to count
 things STOP We can add two numbers if we count up from the first number
 while we count down from the number that is not the first till it come to
 nought SEMISTOP then the first count is the sum STOP 4+2 = 5+1 = 6+0 = 6 

 We shall take the word many to mean  more than two in number STOP  Think
 of a machine that can keep track of two numbers and count each one up or
 down and test if a number be nought and by such a test choose to do this or
 that STOP The list of things that it can do and of choices that it can make
 must be of a known size that is some number STOP Here you can see the two
 numbers and a list STOP Each row in the list has a state name SEMISTOP
 the word  up  or  down SEMISTOP and which number to count upor count down STOP
 For  up  we have the name of the next state to go to and the machine counts the
 number up by one SEMISTOP for  down  the machine first tests the number and so
 we have the name of the new state to go to if the number be nought and the
 name of the new state to go to if the number be other than nought in which
 case the machine counts the number down by one STOP A computer is a machine
 that can do at least what that machine can and we have good cause to think
 that if a computer task can be done at all then the two-number machine can
 do it too if you put numbers in and read them out in the right way STOP

 In some sense all computers are the same SEMISTOP we know this thanks to
 the work of such persons as Alan Turing and Alonzo Church STOP A vocabulary
 is a set of words STOP A language is a vocabularyand rules for what a string
 of words might mean to a person or a machine that hears them STOP To define
 a word is to tell what it means STOPWhen you define a word you add it to your
 vocabulary and to the vocabulary of each person who hears you STOP Then you 
can use the word STOP To program is to make up a list of things to do and
 choices to make to be done by a computer STOP Such a list is called a program
 STOP A noun can be made from a verb to mean that which is done as meant by that
 verb SEMISTOP to make such a noun we add  ing  to the verb stem STOP Thus we
 can speak of  programming STOP  A programming language is a language that
 we can use to tell a computer a program to do STOP Java is abrand name for a
 computer programming language STOP I shall speak of the Java programming
 language a great deal more in this talk STOP I haveto say the full phrase 
 Java programming language  for there is a guy who works where I do who deals
 with the laws of marks of trade and he told me I have to say it that way
 STOP Names of other programming languages are Fortran APL Pascal and PL/I STOP

 A part of a program that does define a new word for use in other parts of the
 program is called a definition STOP Not all programming languages have a way
 to code definitions but most do STOP Those that do not are for wimps STOP
 Should a programming language be small or large? A small programming language
 might take but a short time to learn STOP A large programming language may take
 a long long time to learn but then it is less hard to use for we then have a lot
 of words at hand|or I should say at the tips of our tongues|to use at the drop
 of a hat STOP If we start with a small language then in most cases we can not
 say much at the start STOP We must first define more words SEMISTOP then we
 can speak of the main thing that is on our mind STOP We can use a verb in the
 past tense if we add a  d  or  ed  sound at the end of the verb STOP In the
 same way we can form what we call a past participle which is a form of the
 verb that says of a noun that what the verb means has been done to it STOP

 For this talk I wanted to show you what it is like to use a language that is
 much too small STOP You have now had agood taste of it STOP I must next define
 a few more words STOP An example is some one thing out of a set of things that
 I put in front of you so that you can see how some part of that thing is in
 fact a partof each thing in the set STOP A syllable is a bit of sound that a
 mouth and tongue can say all at one time more or less in a smooth way STOP
 Each word is made up of one or more syllables STOP A primitive is a word for
 which we can take it for granted that we all know what it means STOP For this
 talk I chose to take as my primitives all the wordsof one syllable and no more 
 from the language I use for most of my speech each day which is called English
 STOP My firm rule for this talk is that if I need to use a word of two or more
 syllables I must first define it STOP I can do this by defining one word at a
 time and I have done so or I can give a rule by which a new word can be made
 from some other known word so that many new words can be defined at once|and
 I have done this as well STOP This choice to start withjust words of one
 syllable was why I had to define the word  woman  but could take the word
 man  for granted STOP I wanted to define machine  in terms of the word 
 person  and it seemed least hard to define  person  as  a man or a woman 
 but then by chance the word  man  has one syllable and so is a primitive
 but the word  woman  has two syllables and so I had to define it STOP

 In a language other than English the words that mean  man  and  woman 
 might each have one syllable or might each have two syllables in which
 case one would have to take some other tack STOP We have to dothis a lot
 when we write real computer programs COLON  a thought that seems like a primitive
 in our minds turns out not to be a primitive ina programming language and
 in each new program we must define it once more STOP A good example of this
 is max which yields the more large of two numbers STOP It is a primitive
 thought to me but few programming languages have it as a primitive SEMISTOP
 I have to define it STOP This is the sort of thing that makes a computer look
 like a person who is but four years old STOP Next to English all computer  
 programming languages are small SEMISTOP as we write code we must stop now and
 then to define some new term that we will need to use in more than one place STOP
 Some persons find that their programs have a few large chunks of code that do
 the  real work  plus a large pile of small bits of code that define new words
 so to speak to be used as if they were primitives STOP I hope that this talk
 brings home to you in a way you can feel in your heart not just think in your
 head what it is like to have to program in that way STOP This should show you
 true to life what it is like to use a small language STOP

 Each time I have tried this sort of thing I have found that I can not say much
 at all till I take the time to define at least a few new terms STOP In other
 words if you want to get far at all with a small language you must first add
 to the small language to make a language that is more large STOP In some cases
 we will find it more smooth to add the syllable  er  tothe end of a word than
 to use the word  more  in front of it SEMISTOP inthis way we might say  smoother
 in place of  more smooth STOP  Let me add that better means  more good STOP
 In truth the words of one syllable form quite a rich vocabulary with which you
 can say many things STOP You may note that this vocabulary is much larger than
 that of the language called Basic English defined by Charles Kay Ogden in the
 year one-nine-three-nought STOP I chose not to use Basic English for this talk
 the cause being that Basic English has many wordsof two or more syllables some
 of them quite long handed down to us from the dim past of Rome STOP While Basic
 English has fewer words it does not give the feel to one who speaks full English
 of being a small language STOP By the way from now on I shall use the word
 because to mean  the cause being that STOP  If we look at English and then
 at programming languages we see that all our programming languages seem small
 STOP And yet we can say too in some cases that one programming language is
 smaller than some other programming language STOP A design is a plan for how
 to build a thing STOP To design is to build a thing in ones mind but not yet
 in the real world or better yet to plan how the real thing can be built STOP

 The main thing that I want to ask in this talk is COLON  If I want to help other
 persons to writeall sorts of programs should I design a small programming languageor a large one? I stand on this claim COLON  I should not design a small
 language and I should not design a large one STOP I need to design a language
 that can grow STOP I need to plan ways in which it might grow|but I need too
 to leave some choices so that other persons can make those choices at a later
 time STOP This is not a new thought STOP We have known for some time that huge
 programs can not be coded from scratch all at once STOP There has to be a plan
 for growth STOP What we must stop to think on now is the fact that languages
 have now reached that large size where they can not be designed all at once
 much less built all at once STOP 

 Let me pause to define some names for numbers STOP Twenty is twice ten STOP
 Thirty is thrice ten STOP Forty is twice twenty STOP A hundred is ten times
 ten STOP A million is a hundred times a hundred times a hundred STOP Sixteen
 is twice eight STOP Seven is one plus six STOP Fifty is one more than seven
 squared STOP One more thing COLON  ago means  in the past counting back from now STOP

 In the past it made sense to design a whole language once for all STOP
 Fortran was a small language forty years ago designed for tasks with numbers
 and it served well STOP PL/I was thought a big language thirty years ago but
 now we would think of it as small STOP Pascal was designed as a small whole
 language with no plan to add to it at a later time STOP That was five-and-twenty
 years ago STOP What came to pass? Fortran has grown and grown STOP Many new
 words and new rules have been added STOP The new design is not bad SEMISTOP
 the parts fit well one with the other STOP But to many programmers who have
 used Fortran for a long time the Fortran of here and now is not at all the
 same as the language they first came to know and love STOP It looks strange STOP

 PL/I has not grown much STOP It is for the most part just as it was when it
 first came out STOP It may be that this is just from lack of use STOP The flip
 side is that the lack of use may have two causes STOP Number one COLON  PL/I was not
 designed to grow STOP It was designed to be all things to all who program right
 from the start STOP Number two COLON  for its time it started out large STOP
 No one knew all of PL/I SEMISTOP some said that no one could know all of PL/I
 STOP Pascal grew just a tad and was used to build many large programs STOP
 One main fault of the first design was that strings were hard to use because
 they were all of fixed size STOP Pascal would have been of no use for the
 building of large programs for use in the real world if this had not been changed
 STOP But Wirth had not planned for the language to change in such ways and in
 fact few changes were made STOP At times we think of C as a small language
 designed from whole cloth STOP But it grew out of a smaller language called B
 and has since grown to be a larger language called C plus plus STOP A language
 as large as C plus plus could nothave spread so wide if it had been foisted
 on the world all at once STOP It would have been too hard to port STOP

 One more rule for making words COLON  if we add the syllable  er  to a verb stem
 we make a noun that names the person or thing that does what the verb says
 to do STOP For example a buyer is one who buys STOP A user is one who does
 use STOP As you may by now have guessed I am of like mind with my good friend 
 Dick Gabriel who wrote the well known screed Worse Is Better STOP 
 The real name was  Lisp COLON  Good News Bad News How to Win Big  which is all words
 of just one syllable which might seem like good luck for me but the truth is
 that Dick Gabriel knew how to choose words with punch STOP Yet what first comes
 to mind for most persons is the part headed  Worse Is Better and so that is how
 they cite it STOP The gist of it is that the best way  to get a language used
 by many persons is not to design and build  The Right Thing because that will
 take too long STOP In a race a small language with warts will beat a well
 designed language because users will not wait for the right thing SEMISTOP
 they will use the language that is quick and cheap and put up with the
 warts STOP 
 Once a small language fills a niche it is hard to take its place STOP Well
 then could not  The Right Thing  be a small language not hard to port but
 with no warts? I guess it could be done but I for one am not that smart or
 have not had that much luck STOP But in fact I think it can not be done STOP
 Five-and-twenty years ago when users did not want that much from a programming
 language one could try STOP Scheme was my best shot at it STOP But users will
 not now with glad cries glom on to a language that gives them no more than
 what Scheme or Pascal gave them STOP They need to paint bits lines and boxes
 on the screen in hues bright and wild SEMISTOP they need to talk to printers
 and servers through the net SEMISTOP they need to load code on the y SEMISTOP
 they need their programs to work with other code they dont trust SEMISTOP
 they need to run code in many threads and on many machines SEMISTOP they need
 to deal with text and sayings in all the worlds languages STOP 
 A small programming language just wont cut it STOP So a small language can
 not do the job right and a large language takes too long to get o the ground
 STOP Are we doomed to use small languages with many warts because that is
 the sole kind of design that can make it in the world? At one time this
 thought filled me with gloom STOP But then I saw a gap in my thinking STOP
 I said that users will not wait for  The Right Thing  but will use what comes
 first and put up with the warts STOP 
 But|users will not put up with the warts for all time STOP It is not long till
 they scream and moan and beg for changes STOP The small language will grow
 STOP The warts will be shaved o or patched STOP If one person does all the work
 then growth will be slow STOP But if one lets the users help do the work growth
 can be quick STOP If many persons work side by side and the best work is added
 with care and good taste a great deal can be added in a short time STOP APL was
  designed by one man a smart man|and I love APL|but it had a aw that I think
 has all but killed it COLON  there was no way for a user to grow the language in a
 smooth way STOP In most languages a user can define at least some new words
 to stand for other pieces of code that can then be called in such a way that
 the new words look like primitives STOP In this way the usercan build a larger
 language to meet his needs STOP But in APL new words defined by the user do not
 look like language primitives at all STOP The name of a piece of user code is a
 word but things that are built in are named by strange glyphs STOP To add what
 look like new primitives to keep the feel of the language takes a real hacker
 and a ton of work STOP This has stopped users from helping to grow the language
 STOP APL has grown some but the real work has been done by just the few 
 programmers that have the source code STOP If a user adds to APL and what he
 added seems good to the hackers in charge of the language they might then make
 it be built in but code to use it would not look the same SEMISTOP the user
 would have to change his code to a new form because in APL a use of what is
 built in does not look at all like a call to user code STOP Lisp was designed
 by one man a smart man and it works in a way that I think he did not plan for
 STOP In Lisp newwords defined by the user look like primitives and what is more  all primitives look like words defined by the user! In other words if a user has
 good taste defining new words what comes out is a larger language that has no
 seams STOP The designer in charge can grow the language with close to no work
 on his part just by choosing withcare from the work of many users STOP
 And Lisp grew much faster than APL did because many users could try things
 out and put their best code out there for other users to use and to add to the
 language STOP Lisp is not used quite as much as it used to be but parts of it
 live on in other languages the best of which is called garbage collection and

 I will not try to tell you now what that means in words of one syllable | 
 I leave it to you as a task to try in your spare time STOP This leads me to claim
 that from now on a main goal in designing a language should be to plan for
 growth STOP The language must start small and the language must grow as the
 set of users grows STOP I nowthink that I as a language designer helping out
 with the Java programming language need to ask not  Should the Java programming   language grow?  but  How should the Java programming language grow?  There is 
 more than one kind of growth and more than one way to doit STOP But as we shall
 see if the goal is to be quick and yet to dogood work one mode may be better by
 far than all other modes STOP There are two kinds of growth in a language STOP
 One can change the vocabulary or one can change the rules that say what a string
 of words means STOP A library is a vocabulary designed to be added to a 
 programming language to make the vocabulary of the programming language larger
 STOP Libraries means more than one library STOP A true library does not change
 the rules of meaning for the language SEMISTOP it just adds new words STOP


 You can see from this that in my view the code that lets you do a  long jump
 in C is not a true library STOP Of course there must be a way for a user to make
 libraries STOP But the key point is that the new words defined by a library
 should look just like primitives of the language STOP Some languages are like
 this and some are not STOP Those that are not are harder to grow with the help
 of users STOP It maybe good as well to have a way to add to the rules of meaning
 for a language STOP Some ways to do this work better than other ways STOP
 But the language should let work done by a user look just like what was designed
 at the start STOP I would like to grow the Java programming language in such a
 way that users can do more of this STOP In the same way there are two ways to
 do the growing STOP
 One way is for one person or a small group to be in charge and to take in
 test judge and add the work done by other persons STOP The other way is to
 just put all the source code out there once things start to work and let each
 person do as he wills STOP To have a person in charge can slow things down but
 to have no one in charge makes it harder to add up the workof many persons STOP

 The way that is faster and better than all other ways does both STOP
 Put the source code out there and let all persons play with it STOP
 Have a person in charge who is a quick judge of good work and who
 will take it in and shove it back out fast STOP You dont have to use
 what he ships and you dont have to give back your work but he gives
 all persons a fast way to spread new code to those who want it STOP
 The best example of this way to do things is Linux which is an
 operating system which is a program that keeps track of other
 programs in a computer and gives each its due in space and time STOP
 You ought to read what Eric Raymond had to say of how Linux came to
 be STOP I shall tell you a bit of it once I define two more words for
 you STOP A cathedral is a huge church STOP It may be made of stone
 SEMISTOP it may fill you with awe SEMISTOP but the key thought in the
 mind of Eric Raymond is that there is but one design one grand plan
 which may takea long time many years to make real STOP As the years
 pass few changes are made to the plan STOP Many many persons are
 needed to build it but there is just one designer STOP A bazaar is a
 place with many small shops or stalls where you can buy things from
 many persons who are there to sell their wares STOP The key thought
 here is that each one sells what he wants to sell and each one buys
 what he wants to buy STOP There is no one plan STOP Each seller or
 buyer may change his mind atwhim STOP Eric Raymond wrote a short work
 called The Cathedral and the Bazaar in which he looks at how programs
 are built or have been built in the past STOP You can find it on his
 web site STOP http COLON //www STOPtuxedo
 STOPorg/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar He talks of how he builta mail
 fetching program with the help of more than two hundred users STOP He
 quotes Fred Brooks as saying More users find more bugs and backs him
 up with tales from this example of building a programin the bazaar
 style STOP As for the role of the programmer-in-charge Eric Raymond
 says that it is fine to come up with good thoughts but much better to
 know them when you see them in the work of other persons STOP You can
 get a lot more done that way STOP Linux rose to its heights of fame
 and wide use in much the same way though on a much larger scale STOP
 To take this thought to the far end of the line COLON  it maybe that one
 could write an operating system by putting a million apes to work at
 a million typing-machines then just spotting the bits of good work
 that come out by chance and pasting them up to make a whole STOP But
 that might take a long time I guess STOP Too bad! But the key point
 of the bazaar is not that you can get many persons to work with you
 at a task for cathedral-builders had a great deal of help too STOP
 Nor is the key point that you get help with the designing as well as
 with the building though that in fact is a big win STOP No the key
 point is that in the bazaar style of building a program or designing
 a language or what you will the plan can change in real time to meet
 the needs of those who work on it and use it STOP This tends to make
 users stay with it as time goes by SEMISTOP they will take joyin
 working hard and helping out if they know that their wants and needs
 have s ome weight and their hard work can change the plan for the
 better STOP Which brings me to the high point ofmy talk STOP It seems
 in the last few years at least that if one is asked to speak at this
 meeting one must quote Christopher Alexander STOP I know a bit of his
 work though not a lot and I must say thanks to Dick Gabriel for
 pointing out to me a quote that has a lot to do with the main point
 of this talk STOP I am sad to say that I do not know what this quote
 means because Christopher Alexander tends to use many words of more
 than one syllable and he does not define them first STOP But I have
 learned to say these words by rote and it may be that you out there
 can glean some thoughts of use to you STOP Christopher Alexander
 says COLON  Master plans have two additional unhealthy characteristics STOP
 To begin with the existence of a master plan alienates the users STOP
 After all the very existence of a master plan means by definition
 that the members of the community can have little impact on the
 future shape of their community because most of the important
 decisions havealready been made STOP In a sense under a master plan
 people are living with a frozen future able to affect only relatively
 trivial details STOP When people lose the sense of responsibility for
 the environment they live in and realize that they are merely cogs in
 someone elses machine how can they feel any sense of identification
 with the community or any sense of purpose there? from The Oregon
 Experiment I think this means in part that it is good to give your
 users a chance to buy in and to pitch in STOP It is good for them and
 it is good for you STOP In point of fact a number of cathedrals were
 built in the bazaar mode STOP Does this mean then that it is of no
 use to design? Not at all STOP But instead of designing a thing you
 need to design a way of doing STOP And this way of doing must make
 some choices now but leave other choices to a later time STOP Which
 brings me to the word you all want to hear COLON  a pattern is a plan that
 has some number of parts and shows you how each part turns a face to
 the other parts how each joins with the other parts or stands off how
 each part does what it does and how the other parts aid it or drag it
 down and how all the parts may be grasped as a whole and made to
 serve as one thing for some higher goal or as part of a larger
 pattern STOP A pattern should give hints or clues as to when and
 where it is best put to use STOP What is more some of the parts of a
 pattern may beholes or slots in which other things may be placed at a
 later time STOP A good pattern will say how changes can be made in
 the course oftime STOP Thus some choices of the plan are built in as
 part of the pattern and other choices wait till the time when the
 pattern is to be used STOP In this way a pattern stands for a design
 space in which you can choose on the y your own path for growth and
 change STOP It is good to design a thing but it can be far better and
 far harder to design a pattern STOP Best of all is to know when to
 use a pattern STOP Now for some more computer words STOP A datum is a
 set of bits that has a meaning SEMISTOP data is the mass noun for a
 set of datums STOP An object is a datum the meanings of whose parts
 are laid down by a set of language rules STOP In the Java programming
 language these rules use types to make clear which parts of an object
 may cite other objects STOP Objects may be grouped to form classes
 STOP Knowing the class of an object tells you most of what you need
 to know of how that object acts STOP Objects may have fields SEMISTOP
 each field of an object can hold a datum STOP Which datum it holds
 may change from time to time STOP Each field may have a type which
 tells you what data can be in that field at run time and what is more
 it tells you what data can not be in that field at run time STOP A
 method is a named piece of code that is part of an object STOP If you
 can name or cite an object then you can call amethod of that object
 SEMISTOP the method then does its thing STOP The Java programming
 language has objects and classes and fields and methods and types
 STOP Now I shall speak of some things that the Java
 programming language does not yet have STOP A generic type is a map
 from one or more types to a type STOP Put an other way a generic type
 is a pattern for building types STOP A number of groups of persons
 have set forth ways to add generic types to the Java programming
 language SEMISTOP each way has its own good points STOP We heard
 three talks on adding generic types to the Java programming language
 at this meeting less than three-and-twenty hours ago STOP An operator
 is a glyph such as a plus sign that can be used in a language as if
 it were a word STOP In C or the Java programming language as in
 English the sign first known as and per se and is an operator but a
 full stop or quote mark is notan operator STOP A word is said to be
 overloaded if it is made to meantwo or more things and the hearer has
 to choose the meaning based on the rest of what is said STOP For
 example using the rules defined near the start of this talk a verb
 form such as painted might bea past tense or a past participle and it
 is up to you the hearer to make the call as to which I mean when I
 say it STOP At some times by some persons an overloaded word is
 called polymorphic which means that the word has many forms SEMISTOP
 but the truth is that the word has but one form and many meanings
 STOP The definition of a word may bepolymorphic but the word as such
 is not STOP An operator can be overloaded in C plus plus but right
 now operators in the Java programming language can not be overloaded
 by the programmer though names ofmethods may be overloaded STOP I
 would like to change that STOP I have said in the past and will say
 now that I think it would be a good thing for the Java programming
 language to add generic types and to let the user define overloaded
 operators STOP Just as a user can code methods that can be used in
 just the same way as methods that are built in the user ought to have
 a way to define operators for user-defined classes that can be used
 in just the same way as operators thatare built in STOP What is more
 I would add a kind of class that is oflight weight one whose objects
 can be cloned at will with no harmand so could be kept on a stack for
 speed and not just in the heap STOP Classes of this kind would be
 well-suited for use as user-defined number types but would have other
 uses too STOP You can find a plan for all this on a web page by James
 Gosling STOP http COLON //www STOPjavasoft STOPcom/people/jag/FP STOPhtml
 There are a few other things we could add as well such as tail calls
 and ways to read and write those machine ags for numbers whose points
 oat STOP But these are small language tweaks next to generic types
 and overloaded operators STOP If we grow thelanguage in these few
 ways then we will not need to grow it in a hundred other ways
 SEMISTOP the users can take on the rest of the task STOP To see why
 think on these examples STOP A complex number is a pair of numbers
 STOP There are rules for how to find the sum of two complex numbers
 or a complex number times a complex number COLON  a SEMISTOP b + c SEMISTOP
 d = a + c SEMISTOP b+ d a SEMISTOP b x c SEMISTOP d = a x c + b x d
 SEMISTOP a x d + b x c Some programmers like to use them a lot
 SEMISTOP other programmers do not use themat all STOP So should we
 make complex number a type in the Java programming language? Some say
 yes of course SEMISTOP other persons say no STOP A rational number is
 a pair of numbers STOP There are rules not the same as the rules for
 complex numbers of course for how to find thesum of two rational
 numbers or a rational number times a rationalnumber COLON  a SEMISTOP b + c
 SEMISTOP d = a x d + b x c SEMISTOP b x d a SEMISTOP b x c SEMISTOP d
 = a x c SEMISTOP b x d A few programmers like to use them a lot
 SEMISTOP most do not use them at all STOP So should we make rational
 number a type in the Java programming language? An interval is a pair
 of numbers STOP There are rules not the same as the rules for complex
 numbers or rational numbers of course for how to find the sum of two
 intervals or an interval times an interval COLON  a SEMISTOP b + c SEMISTOP
 d = a + c SEMISTOP b + d a SEMISTOP b x c SEMISTOP d = min a x c
 SEMISTOP a x d SEMISTOP b x c SEMISTOP b x d SEMISTOP max a x c
 SEMISTOP ax d SEMISTOP b x c SEMISTOP b x d A few programmers like to
 use them a lot and wish all the other programmers who use numbers
 would use them too SEMISTOP but most do not use them at all STOP So
 should we make interval a type in the Java programming language? John
 Horton Conway once defined a game to be a pair of sets of games see
 his book On Numbers and Games then pointed out that some games may be
 thought of as numbers that say how many moves it will take to win the
 game STOP There arerules for how to find the sum of two games and so

 for hundreds of kinds of real games how to know which player will win
 STOP I think oh three persons in the world want to use this kind of
 number STOP Should we make it a type in the Java programming
 language? A vector is a row of numbers all of the same type with each
 place in the row named by the kind of number we first spoke of in
 this talk STOPThere are rules STOP STOP STOP In fact for vectors of
 length three there aretwo ways to do a vector times a vector so you
 can have twice the fun! a SEMISTOP b SEMISTOP c + d SEMISTOP e
 SEMISTOP f = a + d SEMISTOP b + e SEMISTOP c + f a SEMISTOP b
 SEMISTOP c x d SEMISTOP e SEMISTOP f = a x d + b x e + c x f a
 SEMISTOP b SEMISTOP c x d SEMISTOP e SEMISTOP f = b x f -c x e
 SEMISTOP c x d - a x f SEMISTOP a x e - b x d Vectors of length three
 or four are a great aid in making bits on the screen look like scenes


 inthe real world STOP So should we make vector a type in the Java
 programming language? A matrix is a set of numbers laid out in a
 square STOP And there are rules not shown here! STOP So should we
 make matrix a type in the Java programming language? And so on and so
 on and so on STOP I might say yes to each one of these but it is
 clear that I must say no to all of them! And so would James
 Goslingand Bill Joy STOP To add all these types to the Java
 programming language would be just too much STOP Some parts of the
 programming vocabularyare fit for all programmers to use but other
 parts are just for their own niches STOP It would not be fair to
 weigh down all programmerswith the need to have or to learn all the
 words for all niche uses STOP We should not make the Java programming
 language a cathedral but a plain bazaar might be too loose STOP What
 we need is more like a shopping mall where there are not quite as
 many choices but most of the goods are well designed and sellers
 stand up and back what they sell STOP I could speak at length on the
 ways in which a shopping mall is like a cathedral but not here not
 now! Now the user could define objects for such numbers to have
 methods that act in the rightways but code to use such numbers would
 look strange STOP Programmers used to adding numbers with plus signs
 would kvetch STOP In fact the Java programming language does have a
 class of big numbers thathave methods for adding them and telling
 which is larger and all the rest and you can not use the plus sign to
 add such numbers and programmers who have to use them do kvetch STOP
 Generic types and overloaded operators would let a user code up all
 of these and in such a way that they would look in all ways just like
 types that are built in STOP They would let users grow the Java
 programming language in a smooth and clean way STOP And it would not
 be just for numbers SEMISTOP generic types would be good for coding
 hash sets for example and thereare many other uses STOP And each user
 would not have to code up such number classes each for his own use
 STOP When a language gives you theright tools such classes can be
 coded by a few and then put up aslibraries for other users to use or
 not as they choose SEMISTOP but they dont have to be built in as part
 of the base language STOP If you give a person a fish he can eat for
 a day STOP If you teach a person to fish he can eat his whole life
 long STOP If you give a person tools hecan make a fishing pole BAR and
 lots of other tools! He can build a machine to crank out fishing
 poles STOP In this way he can help other persons to catch fish STOP
 Meta means that you step back from your own place STOP What you used
 to do is now what you see STOP What you were is now what you act on
 STOP Verbs turn to nouns STOP What you used to think of as apattern
 is now treated as a thing to put in the slot of an other pattern STOP
 A meta-foo is a foo in whose slots you can put parts of a foo STOP In
 a way a language design of the old school is a pattern for programs
 STOP But now we need to go meta STOP We should now think of a
 language design as being a pattern for language designs a tool for
 making more tools of the same kind STOP This is the nub of what I
 want to say STOP A language design can no longer be a thing STOP It
 must be a pattern BAR a pattern for growth BAR a pattern for growing the
 pattern for defining the patterns that programmers can use for their
 real work andtheir main goal STOP My point is that a good programmer
 in these timesdoes not just write programs STOP A good programmer
 builds a working vocabulary STOP In other words a good programmer
 does language design though not from scratch but building on the
 frame of a base language STOP In the course of giving this talk
 because I started with a small language I have had to define fifty or
 more new words or phrasesand sixteen names of persons or things
 SEMISTOP and I laid out six rules for making new words from old ones
 STOP In this way I added to the base language STOP If I were to write
 a book starting from just the words ofone syllable I am sure that I
 would have to define hundreds of new words STOP It should give no one
 pause to note that the writing of a program having a million lines of
 code might need many many hundreds of new words -- that is to say a
 new language built up on the base language STOP I will be so bold as
 to say that it can be done in no other way STOP Well there may be one
 other way which is to use a large rich programming language that has
 grown in the course of tens or hundreds of years that has all we need
 to say what we want to say that we are taught as we grow up and take
 for granted STOP It may be that a hundred years from now there will
 be a programming language that by then has stood the test of time
 needs no more changes for most uses and is used by all persons who
 write programs because each child learns it in school STOP But that
 is not where we are now STOP So STOPLanguage design is not at all the
 same kind of work it was thirty years ago or twenty years ago STOP
 Back then you could set out to design a whole language and then build
 it by your own self or with a small team because it was small and
 because what you would then do with it was small STOP Now programs
 are big messes with many needs STOP A small language wont do the job
 STOP If you design a big language all atonce and then try to build it
 all at once you will fail STOP You willend up late and some other
 language that is small will take your place STOP It would be great if
 there were some small programming language that felt large the way
 Basic English is small but feels large in some ways STOP But I dont
 know how to do it and I have good cause todoubt that it can be done
 at all STOP In its day APL was a small language that felt large
 SEMISTOP but our needs have grown and APL did not have a good pattern
 for growth STOP So I think the sole way to win is to plan for growth
 with help from users STOP This is a win for you because you have help
 STOP This is a win for the users because they get to have their say
 and get to bend the growth to their needs STOP But you need tohave
 one or more persons too or one or more groups to take on the task of
 judging and testing and sifting what the users do and say and adding
 what they think best to the big pile of code in the hope that other
 users will trust what they say and not have to go toall the work to
 test and judge and sift each new claim or each newpiece of code each
 for his own self STOP Parts of the language must be designed to help
 the task of growth STOP A good set of types ways for a user to define
 new types to add new words and new rules to the language to define
 and use all sorts of patterns BAR all these are needed STOP The designer
 should not for example define twenty kinds of number types in the
 language STOP But there will be users who all told beg for twenty
 kinds of numbers STOP The language should have a way forthe user to
 define number types that work well with each other and with plus
 signs and other such signs and with the many ways of pushing bits in
 and out of the computer STOP One might define just one or two number
 types at the start to show how it ought to be done STOP Then leave
 the rest to the users STOP Help them all as best you can to work side
 by side and not nose to nose STOP You may find that you needto add
 warts as part of the design so that you can get it out thedoor fast
 with the goal of taking out the warts at a later time STOP Now there
 are warts and then there are warts! With care one can design a wart
 so that it will not be too hard to take out or patch uplater on STOP
 But if you do not take care at the start you may be stuck for years
 to come with a wart you did not plan STOP Some warts are not bad
 things you put in but good things you leave out STOP Have a plan to
 add those good things at a later time if you should choose to do so
 and make sure that other parts of your design dont cut you o from
 adding those good things when the time is right STOP I hope to bring
 these thoughts to bear on the Java programming language STOP TheJava
 programming language has done as well as it has up to now because it
 started small STOP It was not hard to learn and it was not hardto
 port STOP It has grown quite a bit since then STOP If the design of
 theJava programming language as it is now had been put forth three
 years ago it would have failed BAR of that I am sure STOP Programmers
 would have cried Too big! Too much hair! I cant deal with all that!
 But in real life it has worked out fine because the users have grown
 with the language and learned it piece by piece and they buy in to it
 because they have had some say in how to change the language STOP And
 the Java programming language needs to grow yet some more BAR but I hope
 not a lot more STOP At least I think only a few more rules
 areneeded BAR the rest can be done with libraries most of them built by
 users and not by Sun STOP If we add hundreds of new things to the
 Java programming language we will have a huge language but it will
 take a long time to get there STOP But if we add just a few things --
 generic types operator overloading and user-defined types of light
 weight for use as numbers and small vectors and such BAR that are
 designed to let users make and add things for their own use I think
 we can go a long way and much faster STOP We need to put tools for
 languagegrowth in the hands of the users STOP I hope that we can in
 this way or some other way design a programming language where we
 dont seem to spend most of our time talking and writing in words of
 just one syllable STOP One of the good things I can say for short
 words is that they make for short talks STOP They gave me an hour and
 a half for this talk and I have used less than an hour STOP Once I am
 done you willhave time to go out in the hall have a cup of tea and
 talk with your friends STOP But first I would like to tell you what I
 have learned from the task of designing this talk STOP In choosing to
 give up themany long words that I have come to know since I was a
 child words that have many fine shades of meaning I made this task
 much harder than it needed to be STOP I hope that you have not found
 it too hard on your ears STOP But I found that sticking to this rule
 made me think STOPI had to take time to think through how to phrase
 each thought STOP And there was this choice for each new word COLON  is it
 worth the work to define it or should I just stick with the words I
 have? Should I dothe work of defining a new word such as mirror or
 should I just say looking glass each time I want to speak of one? As
 an example I was tempted more than once to state the ly rule for
 making new words that change what verbs mean but in the end I chose
 to cast all such words to one side and make do STOP And I came that
 close to defining the word without but each time for better or for
 worse I found some other way to phrase my thought STOP I learned in
 my youth from the books of such great teachers of writing as Strunk
 and White that it is better to choose short words when I can STOP
 Ishould not choose long hard words just to make other persons think
 that I know a lot STOP I should try to make my thoughts clear
 SEMISTOP if they are clear and right then other persons can judge my
 work as it ought to be judged STOP From the work of planning this
 talk in which I have tried to go with this rule much more far than in
 the past I found that for the most part they were right STOP Short
 words work well if I choose them well STOP Thus I think that
 programming languages need to be more like the languages we speak but
 it might be good too if we were to use the languages we speak more in
 the way that we now use programming languages STOP All in all I think
 it might be a good thing if those who rule our lives those in high
 places who do the work of state those who judge what we do and most
 of all those who make the laws were made to define their terms and to
 say all else that they say in words of one syllable STOP For I have
 found that this mode of speech makes it hard to hedge STOP It takes
 work and greatcare and some skill to find just the right way to say
 what you want to say but in the end you seem to have no choice but to
 talk straight STOP If you do not veer wide of the truth you are
 forced to hit it dead on STOP I urge you too to give it a try STOP
