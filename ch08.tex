\section{Multiplexor}
\label{sec:mux}

Suppose you want to take two lists and shuffle them into one.
You're looking for a perfect shuffle, an element from one list,
then one from the other list, back to the first list, and so on.
This is sometimes called ``multiplexing.''

The term comes from the realm of signal transmission.
There are many more signals than channels to send them on.
One way to share a channel between two signals is to
send a small part of one signal, then part of the other,
then part of the first one again, and so on.
It could be any number signals sharing the channel, not just two,
but the same kind of round-robin approach would work for any
number of signals.
Multiplexing.

We call the operator ``mux''.
It conforms to the pattern suggested by the following equation.

\hspace{1cm} (mux [$x_1$ $x_2$ $x_3$ $\dots$] [$y_1$ $y_2$ $y_3$ $\dots$]) =
     [$x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $\dots$] \hfill \{\emph{mux}\}

As usual we want to define the mux operator in terms of
a collection of comprehensive, consistent, and computational equations
that it would have to satisfy if it worked properly
(Figure~\ref{fig:inductive-def-keys}, page \pageref{fig:inductive-def-keys}).
If both lists are non-empty,
then the first element of the multiplexed list is the first element of the first list,
and the second element of the multiplexed list is the first element of the other list.
So, the following formula would
get the first two elements of the multiplexed list right.

\hspace{1cm} (mux (cons $x$ $xs$) (cons $y$ $ys$)) =
(cons $x$ (cons $y$ $\dots$ \emph{rest of formula goes here} $\dots$))

Fortunately, there is no great mystery concerning the missing part of the formula.
Multiplexing what's left of the two input lists will get all the elements
in the right place for the perfect shuffle that the mux operator is supposed to deliver.

That gives us an equation that the mux operator
would have to satisfy if it worked properly:

\hspace{1cm} (mux (cons $x$ $xs$) (cons $y$ $ys$)) = (cons $x$ (cons $y$ (mux $xs$ $ys$)))
\hfill \{\emph{mux11}\}

The \{mux11\} equation covers the case when both lists are non-empty.
It's an inductive equation, so we need to be careful to make sure
that the invocation of the mux operator on the right-hand-side
represents a smaller computation the invocation on the left.
If not, the equation will fail to be computational, and
we won't be able to use it to define the operator.
We observe that the operands in the invocation on the
right are shorter lists than the operands on the left.
Only  element shorter, but that's enough.
There is less data to multiplex,
and we would expect that to require less computation.

Therefore, the equation \{\emph{mux11}\} can be used
as a defining axiom. It applies whenever both lists are non-empty.
If both lists are empty, there is nothing to multiplex,
so mux would deliver the empty list in that case, but
what should it deliver if one list is empty, but the other isn't?

There are several reasonable choices, and each of them produces
a different operotr. One choice is to incorporate the elements
in the non-empty list, just as they are, into the
multiplexed list that the mux operator delivers..
That would make mux satisfy the following equations.

\hspace{1cm} (mux nil $ys$) = $ys$ \hfill \{\emph{mux01}\}

\hspace{1cm} (mux $xs$ nil) = $xs$ \hfill \{\emph{mux10}\}

\label{def:mux}
The three equations, \{\emph{mux01}\}, \{\emph{mux10}\}, and \{\emph{mux11}\},
are comprehensive (either both operands are non-empty
or at least one of them is) and computational
(inductive invocations involve less computation).
They are consistent because in the only overlapping case
which occurs
when both lists are empty, both equations
(\{mux01\} and \{mux10\}) specify the same result
(namely, the empty list).
We can, therefore, take the equations as axioms
defining the mux operator.

Converting the axioms to ACL2 notation leads to the following
definition.

\label{mux-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun mux (xs ys)
  (if (not (consp xs))
      ys                                             ; mux0
      (if (not (consp ys))
          xs                                         ; mux10
          (cons (first xs)
                (cons (first ys)
                      (mux (rest xs) (rest ys))))))) ; mux11
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{aside}
The multiplexor operator can be defined with two equations instead of three
by swapping the operands in the inductive equation.
When the first operand is non-empty, then mux must satisfy the following equation.

\hspace{1cm} (mux (cons $x$ $xs$) $ys$) = (cons $x$ (mux $ys$ $xs$)))
\hfill \{mux1y\}

The inductive invocation ``(mux $ys$ $xs$)''
on the right-hand-side of the equation \{mux1y\}
delivers a perfect shuffle
of the lists, starting with the $ys$ list.
So, the formula on the right hand side is a list that starts with $x$,
then alternates between elements of $ys$ and $xs$, which is exactly what
mux should deliver. This leads to a two-equation definition of the mux operator.
The axiom \{mux01\} from the three-equation definition
(page \pageref{def:mux})
covers the case when the first operand is empty.

These two equations form a definition of the mux operator
that delivers the same results as the three-equation definition.
However, the two-equation definition makes reasoning a bit more complicated.
It must take into account the role-switch between the operands
that the inductive equation employs.
The ACL2 system does not find this reasoning trick on its own.
It needs a some guidance.
To make ACL2 admit the two-equation definition,
the program must declare an induction scheme,
as in the following defun.
\\

\label{mux-2eq-defun}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun mux (xs ys)       ; declare induction scheme
   (declare (xargs :measure (+ (len xs) (len ys))))
   (if (consp xs)
       (cons (first xs) (mux ys (rest xs))) ; mux1y
       ys))                                 ; mux01
\end{Verbatim}

\caption{Defining mux with Two Equations}
\label{aside:mux-2eq}
\end{aside}

As always, the axioms that define an operator
determine not only the properties they specify
but also determine all of the other properties of the operator.
What properties would we expect the mux operator to have?
Surely, the number of elements in the multiplexed list
would be the sum of the lengths of it operands.
The following ACL2 definition states this property formally,
and ACL2 succeeds in finding a proof by induction.

\label{mux-length-thm}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defthm mux-length-thm
  (= (len (mux xs ys))
     (+ (len xs) (len ys))))
\end{Verbatim}

For practice, let's construct a pencil-and-paper proof of the theorem.
There are many ways to proceed.
One is to induct on the length of the first operand.
We are trying to prove that the following equation holds for all natural numbers, $n$.

\hspace{1cm} (len(mux [$x_1$ $x_2$ $\dots$ $x_n$] $ys$)) = $n$ + (len $ys$) \hfill \{$L(n)$\}

The proof of the base case, L(0) (that is, $xs$ = nil), is short.

Base case: L(0) $\equiv$ ((len(mux nil $ys$)) = 0 + (len $ys$))

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    & (len(mux nil $ys$))                             &                     \\
$=$ & (len $ys$)                                      & \{\emph{mux01}\}    \\
$=$ & 0 + (len $ys$)                                  & \{\emph{algebra}\}  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\label{mux-length-thm-induc-case}
Inductive case: L(0) $\equiv$ (len(mux [$x_1$ $x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] $ys$)) = $(n+1)$ + (len $ys$)

We split the inductive case, $L(n+1)$, into two parts.
The second operand of mux is either nil or it's not.
We derive the conclusion from both possibilities and cite the \{$\vee$ elimination\}
inference rule (page \pageref{fig-02-deduction-rules})
to conclude that $L(n+1)$ holds.

The proof of the part when $ys$ is nil is like the proof when $xs$ is nil,
except that it cites \{\emph{mux10}\} instead of \{\emph{mux01}\},
The proof of the part when the second operand is non-empty,
and therefore has the form (cons $y$ $ys$),
is more complicated. Let's look at it in detail.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    & (len(mux [$x_1$ $x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] (cons $y$ $ys$)))             &   \\
$=$ & (len(mux (cons $x_1$ [$x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] (cons $y$ $ys$))))      & \{\emph{cons}\} (page \pageref{first-rest-cons}) \\
$=$ & (len(cons $x$ (cons $y$ (mux [$x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] (cons $ys$))))) & \{\emph{algebra}\} \\
$=$ & 1 + (1 + (len(mux [$x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] (cons $ys$))))             & \{\emph{len1}\} twice (page \pageref{len-equations}) \\
$=$ & 1 + (1 + ($n$ + (len(cons $ys$))))                                     & \{\emph{L(n)}\} (ind hyp) \\
$=$ & ($n$ + 1) + (1 + (len(cons $ys$)))                                     & \{\emph{algebra}\} \\
$=$ & ($n$ + 1) + (len(cons $y$ $ys$))                                       & \{\emph{len1}\} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This completes the proof of the inductive case,
so we conclude that the equation L($n$) is true for all natural numbers $n$.
Therefore, the mux-length theorem is true.

The next section discusses an operator that goes in the other direction.
It ``demultiplexes'' a list into two lists, inverting the perfect shuffle.
We will prove that the demultiplexor preserves total length and values,
like the multiplexor.
We will also prove that the two operators invert each other.

\begin{ExerciseList}
\Exercise
Our proof of the inductive case, L($n+1$), of the mux-length theorem
(page \pageref{mux-length-thm-induc-case})
glossed over the part when the second operand is empty.
Complete that part of the proof. That is, prove the following equation.

\hspace{1cm} (len(mux [$x_1$ $x_2$ $\dots$ $x_{n+1}$] nil)) = $(n+1)$ + (len nil)

\Exercise [label={ex:mul-val-thm}]
Prove that the mux operator neither adds nor loses values from its operands.
That is, a value that occurs in either $xs$ or $ys$ also occurs in (mux $xs$ $ys$)
and, vice versa, a value that occurs in (mux $xs$ $ys$) also occurs in either $xs$ or $ys$.
We will call this the ``mux-val'' theorem:

\label{thm:mux-val}
\hspace{1cm} ((occurs-in $v$ $xs$) $\vee$ (occurs-in $v$ $ys$)) $\leftrightarrow$ (occurs-in $v$ (mux $xs$ $ys$)) \hfill \{\emph{mux-val-thm}\}

\label{def:equivalence-op}
The ``$\leftrightarrow$'' operator in the formula is Boolean equivalence.
If $p$ and $q$ are Boolean values (True or False),
then $p \leftrightarrow q$ = $((p \rightarrow q) \wedge (q \rightarrow p))$.

The ``occurs-in'' predicate is defined as follows.

\label{def:occurs-in}
\hspace{1cm} (occurs-in $v$ $xs$) = (consp $xs$) $\wedge$ (($v$ = (first $xs$)) $\vee$ (occurs-in $v$ (rest $xs$)))
\hfill \{\emph{occurs-in}\}

\emph{Hint:} The inductive case of your proof
(that is, the case when $xs$ is non-empty)
can cite the \{$\vee$ elimination\} inference rule,
as in the proof of the mux-length theorem (page \pageref{mux-length-thm}).
The proof of the inductive case will have two parts.
In one part, the value $v$ will be equal to
the first element of $xs$:
$v$ = (first $xs$).
In the other part, $v$ will occur in (rest $xs$).
That is, (occurs-in $v$ (rest $xs$)) will be true.
Prove both parts, separately.
Since they have the same conclusion,
\{$\vee$ elimination\} confirms that the conclusion is true.
\end{ExerciseList}

\begin{aside}
In Exercise \ref{ex:mul-val-thm}, the mux-val theorem,
and the axioms for the occurs-in predicate
have been stated in the form we use for pencil-and-paper proofs.
These proofs are rigorous, but not formal
in the sense of the mechanized proofs of ACL2.

Below is an ACL2 formalization of these ideas,
which the ACL2 system succeeds in admitting.
The "iff" operator is Boolean equivalence:
(iff $p$ $q$) means $(p \leftrightarrow q)$,
that is, $((p \rightarrow q) \wedge (q \rightarrow p))$.

\begin{Verbatim}
(defun occurs-in (x xs)
  (if (consp xs)
      (or (equal x (first xs))
          (occurs-in x (rest xs)))
      nil))
(defthm mux-val-thm
  (iff (occurs-in v (mux xs ys)) ; iff means <->
       (or (occurs-in v xs)
           (occurs-in v ys))))

\section{Demultiplexor}
\label{sec:dmx}

A demultiplexor transforms a list of signals that alternate between
$x$-values and $y$-values into two lists,
with the $x$-values in one list and $y$-values in the other.

\hspace{1cm} (dmx [$x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $\dots$]) =
[[$x_1$ $x_2$ $x_3$ $\dots$] [$y_1$ $y_2$ $y_3$ $\dots$]]
\hfill \{\emph{dmx}\}

If dmx works properly, then it should package a list
that alternates between $y$-values and $x$-values
(starting with $y$-values) into two lists,
the first one containing the $y$-values,
the second, the $x$-values.

\hspace{1cm} (dmx [$y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $\dots$]) =
[[$y_1$ $y_2$ $y_3$ $\dots$] [$x_2$ $x_3$ $\dots$]]

Therefore, dmx must satisfy the following equation.

\hspace{1cm} (dmx (cons $x$ $yxs$)) = [(cons $x$ $xs$) $ys$] \hfill \{\emph{dmx1}\}

\hspace{1.4cm} where [$ys$ $xs$] = (dmx $yxs$)

The equation \{\emph{dmx1}\} applies whenever the operand is non-empty.
When the operand is empty, dmx must deliver a package of two empty lists:

\hspace{1cm} (dmx nil) = [nil nil] \hfill \{\emph{dmx0}\}

Together, the equations \{\emph{dmx0}\} and \{\emph{dmx1}\}
are comprehensive, consistent, and computational, so we
take them as defining axioms for dmx.

The following definition in ACL2 provides a formal version of the axioms.

\label{defun:dmx}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun dmx (xys)
  (if (consp xys)
      (let* ((x (first xys))
             (ysxs (dmx (rest xys)))
             (ys (first ysxs))
             (xs (second ysxs)))
        (list (cons x xs) ys))      ; dmx1
      (list xys xys)))              ; dmx0
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{aside}
The ACL2 version of equation \{\emph{dmx0}\} is a bit tricky.
Whereas, the pencil-and-paper version of the equation
says that dmx delivers the value [nil nil],
the ACL2 version says it delivers the value (list $xys$ $xys$),
where $xys$ is the operand.
The ``if'' operation in the definition selects this formula
when (consp $xys$) is false.

Normally, (consp $xys$) being false would mean that $xys$ is nil.
However, it doesn't
necessarily carry that meaning.
It just means that $xys$ is not an object constructed by
the cons operator.
It could be, for example, a number, such as 27 or 12 or zero.
We are expecting $xys$, as an operand of dmx, to be a list.
If $xys$ is a list,
then the only list it could be when (consp $xys$) is false
is the empty list. So, (list $xys$ $xys$) is the same
as (list nil nil) under normal circumstances.
That is, when $xys$ is a list and (consp $xys$) is false.

In the formal, ACL2 definition,
we us the formula (list $xys$ $xys$) instead of (list nil nil)
to account for abnormal circumstances, in case the operand $xys$
is not a list. That makes it possible to derive theorems that
hold under more general circumstances, thereby simplifying the
mechanized reasoning that ACL2 carries out.
\label{aside:dmx-defun-trick}
\end{aside}

Like the the multiplexor operator,
the demultiplexor operator, preserves total length
and neither adds nor loses values the list supplied as its operand.
ACL2 succeeds in verifying these facts without assistance,
and the pencil-and-paper proofs are similar to the corresponding
theorems for the multiplexor.

The two operators also satisfy some round-trip properties
that provide a lot of confidence that they do what we expect them to do.
Demultiplexing a list of $x$-$y$ values into the list of
$x$-values and the list of $y$-values, then multiplexing
those two lists, reproduces the original list of $x$-$y$ values.

\label{thm:mux-inverts-dmx}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defthm mux-inverts-dmx-thm
  (equal (mux (first  (dmx xys))
              (second (dmx xys)))
         xys))
\end{Verbatim}

It works the other way around, too, if the operands of
the mux operator are lists of the same length.

\label{thm:dmx-inverts-mux}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defthm dmx-inverts-mux-thm
  (implies (and (true-listp xs) (true-listp ys)
                (= (len xs) (len ys)))
           (equal (dmx (mux xs ys))
                  (list xs ys))))
\end{Verbatim}

These inversion properties provide the kinds
of guarantees that people using the operators
might want to know, for sure, to have confidence that
the operators are correctly defined.

\begin{ExerciseList}
\Exercise
Prove that the dmx operator preserves total length.
That is, prove the theorem
stated formally in ACL2 as follows.

     (+ (len (first (dmx xys)))
