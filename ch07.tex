Chapter \ref{ch:adders} discussed circuits for adding binary numerals of a
fixed word length.
The ACL2 model (Figure \ref{fig:adder}, page \pageref{fig:adder})
assumed that both numerals had exactly $w$ bits, $w$ being the word size.
The circuit diagram reflected this assumption by
showing $2w$ input wires ($w$ lines for each numeral) and
$w$ output wires for the numeral denoting the sum.

The diagram has an additional input wire for the carry bit
coming into the adder (normally a zero bit, unless the circuit is being
used for some sort of multi-word arithmetic) and an additional output wire
for the output carry bit.
The output carry bit is normally ignored in single-word arithmetic
when one addend is positive and the other is negative,
but can be used to detect overflow\footnote{Overflow occurs
when the sum of the two input numerals falls outside
the range of numbers representable in $w$-bit, twos-complement
arithmetic.}
when they have the same sign.

The ACL2 model received the input carry as its first operand
and the two input numerals as lists of length $w$ as second and third operands.
It delivered its output as a list of two elements,
the first element being a list of $w$ sum bits,
and the second element being the carry out.
The model, like the circuit, did not allow for input numerals
of differing lengths.
That is the nature of physical circuits.
They have a fixed number of wires and gates.

Software has no such constraint.
A software component for adding binary numerals can accept
numerals of any length, and the two numerals need not have the same length.
The numeral representing the sum would then have as many bits as
required to represent the sum of the numbers
denoted by the input.

An adder expressed in software that is able to deal with numerals
\index{bignum!addition (add, add-1, add-c)}\index{addition!bignum}
of any length is often called a bignum adder.
It performs precise arithmetic on numbers of any size
rather than on a fixed range of numbers based on word size.
To simplify the discussion, we will talk about arithmetic
for non-negative integers only.
Negative integers and fractions make things a lot more complicated
without adding much in the way of intellectual depth.
Bignum arithmetic on non-negative integers provides plenty of room
for small projects to build an understanding of the concepts.

\section{Bignum Adder}
\label{sec:bignum-adder}

To begin, let's see what it takes to convert our ACL2 model for
the ripple-carry adder to software that performs addition on
binary numerals with an arbitrary number of bits,
representing numbers of unlimited size.
One way to begin is to work out a way to increment a
binary numeral by one. That is, given a binary numeral $x$ representing
the number $n$, we seek a way to compute the numeral for the number $n+1$:
(add-1 $x$) = numeral for (+ (numb $x$) 1).

Following our usual practice when we are trying to define an operator,
we assume that someone has already defined it,
and all we have to do is to write some equations that it
would have to satisfy if it worked. If we manage
to come up with equations that are consistent, comprehensive, and computational
(Figure~\ref{fig:inductive-def-keys}, page \pageref{fig:inductive-def-keys})
we will have defined an operator.
However, it won't be just any operator.
It will be the only operator that satisfies those equations.

A particularly simple situation occurs when the numeral to be incremented
has no bits in it. The interpretation we settled on
in Chapter \ref{ch:binary-numerals} is that
the empty numeral stands for the number zero
(\{numb0\} in the definition of numb, page \pageref{nmb-defun}).
So, incrementing the empty numeral should produce a numeral for the number $1$,
which is the list [$1$].

\hspace{1cm}(add-1 nil) = (list $1$) = (cons $1$ nil)  \hfill \{add1nil\}

Another simple situation occurs when the low-order bit in the
numeral to be incremented is a zero.
In that case, the ouput numeral is
just like the input numeral, except that its
low-order bit is a one rather than a zero.

\hspace{1cm}  (add-1 (cons 0 x)) = (cons 1 x)    \hfill \{add10\}

At this point, we have equations to cover all numerals
that have either no bits at all or a low-order bit
of zero. If we can work out an equation for numerals
with a low-order bit of one, our equations will be comprehensive.
To do this, let's think about the
low-order bit of the incremented numeral.
Since adding a one-bit to a one-bit produces a sum-bit
of zero and a carry-bit of one
(Figure~\ref{fig:half-adder}, page \pageref{fig:half-adder}),
we conclude that the low-order bit of the incremented numeral
is zero.

But, what about the carry-bit? What do we do with that?
It will need to be added to the higher-order bits of
the input numeral. But, that is just a matter of incrementing
the higher-order bits by one.
The higher-order bits are, themselves, a numeral,
and because of our standard assumption that
someone has already defined the operator we need,
we can just use it to increment that numeral.
That is, we can write an inductive equation that the add-1 operator
must satisfy.

\hspace{1cm}  (add-1 (cons 1 x)) = (cons 0 (add-1 x))   \hfill \{add11\}

Now we have three equations.
They are consistent (no overlapping cases) and
comprehensive (all cases covered).
The equations are also computational because the input numeral in
the inductive equation \{add11\} is shorter than
the numeral on the left-hand-side of the equation.
Therefore, the equations define the add-1 operator.
All we need to do now is to combine them into an ACL2 definition.

\label{add-1-defun}\index{equation, by name!\{add10\}, \{add11\}}
\index{operator, by name!add, add-1, add-c (\emph{see} bignum)}
\index{add, add-1, add-c (\emph{see} bignum)}
\index{bignum!addition (add, add-1, add-c)}\index{arithmetic!bignum addition}\index{addition!bignum}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun add-1 (x)
  (if (and (consp x) (= (first x) 1))
      (cons 0 (add-1 (rest x)))      ; {add11}
      (cons 1 (rest x))))            ; {add10}
\end{Verbatim}

It turns out that the \{add1nil\} equation
and the \{add10\} equation can be expressed as one equation because
the ACL2 formula (cons 1 (rest $x$)), which is the proper
translation for the right-hand-side of \{add10\} equation,
also works for the right-hand-side of the \{add1nil\} equation
because (cons 1 (rest nil)) $=$ (cons 1 nil) $=$ (list 1).
This observation reduces the definition from three equations to two,
and completes the definition of the add1 operator.

The ripple-carry adder propagated the carry from each bit position
to the next higher-order bit position.
Each bit position involved three input bits
(a carry and one bit from each addend).
Our bignum adder will do that, too.
Each bit in the sum will depend on the
corresponding bits in the addends and the carry from
the previous, lower-order bit.

We already have the apparatus for this: the full-adder operator
(Figure~\ref{fig:full-adder},  page \pageref{fig:full-adder}).
We can use that operator, to add two corresponding bits,
$x_n$ and $y_n$, from the addend numerals,
incorporating the carry, $c_n$, from the lower-order bit position.
The full-adder delivers the sum bit, $s_n$, for the current
bit position and the carry bit, $c_{n+1}$, for the next bit position.
\begin{center}
[$s_n$ $c_{n+1}$] = (full-adder $c_n$ $x_n$ $y_n$)
\end{center}

That analysis provides the basis for
one of the equations for the bignum adder.
That equation covers the situation when both addends have
low-order bits. (This was always the case when
the numerals had the same number of bits, but in bignum
arithmetic we will eventually need to account for the
case when one numeral has more bits than the other,
so that the numerals will not have corresponding bits
beyond a certain point.)
In the case where the corresponding bits involved
are the low-order bits in the numerals,
that equation would sketch out as follows.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
(add $c_0$ [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ \dots ] [$y_0$ $y_1$ $y_2$ \dots ]) = [$s_0$ $s_1$ $s_2$ \dots ]   & \{addxy\} \\
where & \\
$[s_0$ $c_1] =$ (full-adder $c_0$ $x_0$ $y_0$) & \\
$[s_1$ $s_2 \dots ] =$ (add $c_1$ $[x_1$ $x_2 \dots ]$ $[y_1$ $y_2 \dots ]$) & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This equation covers all addends whose numerals have at least one bit.
So, all we need to do to make our equations comprehensive
is to have equations for the cases when one or the other addend is an empty numeral.

If either addend is an empty numeral, then that addend denotes the number zero,
and the sum would be the other addend with the carry added to it.
We already have an operator, add1 (page \pageref{add-1-defun}),
that we can use to add the carry if it's a one-bit.
When the carry is a zero-bit, we don't need to add the carry bit
because adding zero doesn't change the number.

\label{add-c-defun}
\index{equation, by name!\{addc0\}, \{addc1\}}
\index{add, add-1, add-c (\emph{see} bignum)}
\index{bignum!addition (add, add-1, add-c)}\index{addition!bignum}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun add-c (c x)
  (if (= c 1)
      (add-1 x)  ; [addc1}
      x))        ; {addc0}
\end{Verbatim}

That gives us a way to write the equations when either of the addends is empty.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
(add $c$ $x$ nil) = (add-c $c$ $x$)   & \{add10\} \\
(add $c$ nil $y$) = (add-c $c$ $y$)   & \{add01\} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now, with all the cases covered, we can translate our sketched equations
into ACL2.

\label{bignum-add-defun}
\index{equation, by name!\{add0y\}, \{addx0\}, \{addxy\}}
\index{add, add-1, add-c (\emph{see} bignum)}
\index{addition!carry}
\index{numeral!bignum addition}\index{addition!bignum}
\index{arithmetic!bignum addition}
\index{bignum!addition (add, add-1, add-c)}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defun add (c0 x y)
  (if (not (consp x))
      (add-c c0 y)                                   ; {add0y}
      (if (not (consp y))
          (add-c c0 x)                               ; {addx0}
          (let* ((x0 (first x))
                 (y0 (first y))
                 (a  (full-adder c0 x0 y0))
                 (s0 (first a))
                 (c1 (second a)))
            (cons s0 (add c1 (rest x) (rest y))))))) ; {addxy}
\end{Verbatim}

Let's look at some examples of the bignum add operator in action.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
(add $0$ [$0$ $1$]             &[$0$ $1$]~~~~)  &$=$ &[$0$ $0$ 1]           & $2 + 2 = 4$   \\
(add $0$ [$0$ $1$ $1$ $1$]     &[$1$ $0$ $1$]~) &$=$ &[$1$ $1$ $0$ $0$ $1$] & $14 + 5 = 19$ \\
(add $0$ [$1$ $0$ $0$ $1$ $1$] &[$0$ $1$ $1$]~) &$=$ &[$1$ $1$ $1$ $1$ $1$] & $25 + 6 = 31$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The properties that the bignum add operator is designed to satisfy
deliver a binary numeral for the sum of
the numbers represented by the input numerals and the input carry.
The examples show that the property holds for three
particular pairs of addends.
Of course we would like to know that it
holds for all input numerals, and
the following theorem is a formal assertion of that fact.

\label{bignum-adder-thm}
\index{theorem!bignum addition}\index{theorem, by name!\{bignum-add-ok\}}
\index{bignum!addition (add, add-1, add-c)}\index{addition!bignum}
\begin{Verbatim}
(defthm bignum-add-ok
  (= (numb(add c x y))
     (+ (numb (list c)) (numb x) (numb y))))
\end{Verbatim}

The ACL2 system succeeds in proving this theorem by induction,
and we could do a paper-and-pencil proof following a strategy
similar to the one for the \{adder ok\} theorem about the ripple-carry adder
(Figure~\ref{fig:adder-thm-prf}, page \pageref{fig:adder-thm-prf}).
In any case, we know now, to a mathematical certainty,
that the bignum add operator delivers
the sum of its two input numerals and the input carry bit.

The theorem refers to the fin operator (page \pageref{fin-defun}).

\section{Shift-and-Add Multiplier}
\label{sec:bignum-mult}

The grade-school method of multiplying big numbers proceeds one digit at a time,
from right (low-order digit of the decimal numeral) to left (higher order digits).
The first step is to multiply the entire multiplicand by the low-order digit
of the multiplier.
Then comes next-to-last digit of the multiplier (the tens digit) for the second step.
In the second step, the product is written below the one from the first step,
but shifted left one position.
This continues across all of the digits of the multiplier, one by one,
writing the products shifted one more position to the left at each step.
After the products are completed for
all the digits in the multiplier, they are totaled, taking care to keep
the digits lined up according to the left shifts that occurred at each stage.

Grade-school students learn this procedure without knowing
the algebra behind it. However, we want to use a collection of
equations to specify the product of numerals, so we need
to know the algebra. Our analysis will use the following nomenclature.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$x$       &\emph{number represented by numeral of multiplier} \\
$x_0$     &\emph{low-order digit of numeral for} $x$ \emph{(the multiplier) } \\
$y$       &\emph{ number represented by numeral of multiplicand} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The procedure for multiplying numerals relies on the following equation,
which grade-school students use to check the correctness of their long-division problems:

\hspace{2mm} $x = (\lfloor x \div d \rfloor \cdot d) + $($x$ mod $d)$ \hfill \{long-division\}\footnote{As
usual$\lfloor x\rfloor$ stands for the greatest integer that is $x$ or less,
and $(x$ mod $d)$ is the remainder when $x$ is divided by $d$ (modular arithmetic).}

If we let $d = 10$ and multiply both sides of the \{long-division\} equation by $y$,
we arrive at the following equation.

\hspace{2cm} $xy = (\lfloor x \div 10 \rfloor \cdot 10 \cdot y) + ((x$ mod $10) \cdot y)$
\hfill \{long division by 10\} \\

Observe that $(x$ mod $10)$ is $x_0$, the low-order digit of $x$.
So, the low-order digit of the numeral for $x$, times $y$ is
$(x$ mod $10) \cdot y$. That is, $x_0 \cdot y$.
Also, the numeral for the number
$\lfloor x \div 10 \rfloor$ is the same as the numeral for $x$, but
without its low-order digit
Therefore, $\lfloor x \div 10 \rfloor \cdot y$ is the number that
comes from multiplying $y$ by the numeral for $x$ without its low-order digit.

In other words, the \{long-division\} equation
provides the basis for computing $xy$.
First, multiply $y$ by the low-order
digit of the numeral for $x$.
Then, multiply $y$ by the number
represented by the other digits of the numeral for $x$.
Finally, shift that product one digit to the left,
and add the number from the first step in the procedure.
It simplifies the process to observe that
because the product will be shifted before the addition takes place,
the low-order digit of the sum will be the low-order digit of
the numeral from the first stage
(the step where we multiplied $y$ by the low-order digit of the numeral for $x$).
Because of the left-shift, there is nothing to add to the low-order digit of
the numeral from the first stage.

The left-shift amounts to multiplying by 10: $\lfloor x \div 10 \rfloor \cdot y \cdot 10$.
The number from the first step in the procedure is $(x$ mod $10) \cdot y$.
Therefore, the procedure computes
$xy = \lfloor x \div 10 \rfloor \cdot y \cdot 10 + (x$ mod $10) \cdot y$

Of course, our bignum multiplier
will use binary numerals rather than decimal numerals.
Except for this detail, the procedure is the same
as with grade-school multiplication of decimal numerals
except that we specialize the \{long division\} equation to the case when $d = 2$.

\hspace{2cm} $xy = \lfloor x \div 2 \rfloor \cdot y \cdot 2 + (x$ mod $2) \cdot y$
\hfill \{long division by 2\} \\

In this case, $(x$ mod $2)$ is the low-order bit in the binary numeral for $x$.
And, $\lfloor x \div 2 \rfloor$ is the number represented by the binary numeral for $x$
without its low-order bit.
That is, if [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ ...] were the numeral for $x$,
written as a sequence of bits, starting with the low-order bit,
then $x_0$ would be $(x$ mod $2)$ and [$x_1$ $x_2$ ...] would be the numeral for
$\lfloor x \div 2 \rfloor$.

The grade-school procedure, applied to binary numerals, goes as follows:
First, multiply $x_0$ times $y$. The low-order bit of this product will be the low-order bit
of the binary numeral of $xy$. Call it $m_0$. In grade school, this is called ``bringing
down'' the digit. The way is clear because the other part of the product will be shifted.

Then, multiply the other bits of the binary numeral of $x$ times the multiplicand, $y$.
Add the binary numeral for this product to the binary numeral of $x$ without its
low-order bit. Let's give names to the bits of this numeral: [$m_1$ $m_2$ ...]
Then insert the low-order bit from the first product (namely, $m_0$) to form
the numeral for $xy$ = [$m_0$ $m_1$ $m_2$ ...].

There is another aspect of using binary numerals rather than decimal numerals
that simplifies the procedure. It is this:
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x_0 = 0$, $x_0 \cdot y = 0$,
        so the empty numeral serves as the numeral for $x_0 \cdot y$.
  \item If $x_0 = 1$,
        $x_0 \cdot y = y$, so the numeral for $y$ serves
        as the numeral for $x_0 \cdot y$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

Therefore, when $x_0$ is zero, the $m_0$ that we ``bring down'' and insert into
[$m_1$ $m_2$ ...] to form the numeral of the product of $x$ and $y$
is, in this case, a zero. On the other hand, when $x_0$ is a one,
the $m_0$ that we bring down is the low-order bit of the numeral for $y$.

We are looking for some equations that define a binary multiplication operator.
That is, an operator that delivers the binary numeral for the product of the numbers
represented by its operands, which are also binary numerals.
As usual, we assume that such an operator has already been defined,
and we look for a set of consistent, comprehensive, and computational
equations that it would have to satisfy.

Now, let's focus on the multiplication operator for binary numerals.
Call it ``mul.'' The invocation (mul $x$ $y$),
given binary numerals $x$ and $y$, would
deliver the numeral for the product of numbers that $x$ and $y$ represent.
(We have shifted our nomenclature to reflect our new focus:
$x$ and $y$ now stand for binary numerals
instead of numbers.)
If the numeral $x$ is empty, it denotes the number zero, so the product
will be zero, and the empty numeral will serve as the result.
That gives us one equation:

\hspace{2cm} (mul nil $y$) = nil \hspace{2cm} \hfill \{mul0y\}
\\

If the multiplier $x$ = [$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ ...] is not empty,
then we are going to need to compute the product of the other
high-order bits of $x$ and $y$: $m$ = (mul [$x_1$ $x_2$ ...] $y$).

The low-order bit of $x$ (call it $x_0$, as we did earlier),
must be either zero or one.
If $x_0$ is zero, we bring down a zero and insert it into the product, $m$,
of [$x_1$ $x_2$ ...] and $y$. That gives us another equation:

\hspace{2cm} (mul [0 $x_1$ $x_2$ ...] $y$) = (cons 0 $m$) \hfill \{mul0xy\}
\\

If $x_0$ is one, the computation is a bit more complicated.
To examine it in detail, let $u$, $v$, and $w$ be the numbers
that the numerals $x$, $y$, and $m$ stand for.
That is $u$ = (numb $x$), $v$ = (numb $y$), and $w$ = (numb $m$).
We are trying to compute the product of the numerals $x$ and $y$
That is, we are trying to compute the numeral for $u \cdot v$.

When $x_0$, the low-order bit of $x$, is one, $u$ is an odd number.
Therefore, $u = 1 + 2 \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor$,
Also, $w = \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor \cdot v$
because (numb [$x_1$ $x_2$ ...]) = $\lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor$.

Therefore,

\hspace{1cm} $u \cdot v$ = $(1 + 2 \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor) \cdot v$
\hfill $u = 1 + 2 \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor$

\hspace{1.7cm} = $v + 2 \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor \cdot v$
\hfill \{\emph{distributive law}\}

\hspace{1.7cm} = (mod $v$ 2) + $2 \lfloor v \div 2 \rfloor + 2 \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor \cdot v$
\hfill \{\emph{long division of} $v$ \emph{by} 2\}

\hspace{1.7cm} = (mod $v$ 2) + $2(\lfloor v \div 2 \rfloor + \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor \cdot v)$
\hfill \{\emph{distributive law}\}

\hspace{1.7cm} = (mod $v$ 2) + $2(\lfloor v \div 2 \rfloor + w)$
\hfill $w = \lfloor u \div 2 \rfloor \cdot v$

We observe that (mod $v$ 2) is the low-order bit of $y$,
and we recall that (rest $y$) is the numeral for $\lfloor v \div 2 \rfloor$
and that $m$ is the numeral for $w$.
Therefore, we can get the numeral for $u \cdot v$
by inserting low-order bit of $y$, which is (mod $v$ 2),
at the beginning of the sum of the numerals (rest $y$) and $m$.
This amounts to bringing down the low-order bit of $y$
and inserting it into the sum of the other bits of $y$ and $m$.
That leads to the following equation.

\hspace{2cm} (mul [1 $x_1$ $x_2$ ...] $y$) = (cons (first $y$) (add 0 (rest $y$) $m$)) \hfill \{mul1xy\}
\\

Finally, if $y$ is empty, it denotes zero, so the empty numeral
serves as the product. That gives us one more equation:

\hspace{2cm} (mul $x$ nil) = nil \hfill \{mulx0\}
\\

These equations are comprehensive because $y$ is either empty,
in which case equation \{mx0\} applies,
or $y$ is not empty.
If $y$ is not empty, then either $x$ is empty, in which case
equation \{m0y\} applies, or $x$ is not empty.
If $x$ is not empty, its low-order bit is either zero,
in which case equation \{m0xy\} applies, or it is one,
in which case equation \{m1xy\} applies.

The equations are consistent because in the one case
where they might overlap, namely when both $x$ and $y$
are empty, they deliver the same result, namely the empty numeral.

They are computational because in the inductive equations,
\{m0xy\} and \{m1xy\}, the first operand in
the invocation of the operator, mul, on the right-hand side
is the numeral [$x_1$ $x_2$ ...], which has fewer bits
than the numeral on the left-hand side, which is
[$x_0$ $x_1$ $x_2$ ...].
So, the inductive invocation is closer to a non-inductive
case than the formula on the left-hand side of the equation.

Putting this all together leads to the following ACL2 definition
of the bignum multiplication operator, mul.
Most of the work is done by the operator mxy,
which is invoked by mul when the multiplicand, $y$,
is not the empty numeral.
