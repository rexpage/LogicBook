\label{ch:Acknowledgements}

The authors would like to thank Caleb Eggensperger for developing
the Proof Pad environment that has eased many students 
through early experiences with mechanized logic. 
Carl Eastland, Dale Vaillancourt, and Matthias Felleisen 
built an ACL2 environment that one of the authors relied on 
for many course offerings and which
included DoubleCheck, the predicate-based, automated testing facility 
based on ideas in QuickCheck, the grandaddy 
of such tools invented by John Hughes and Koen Claessen,
that was later incorporated into Proof Pad. 
We thank them for their pioneering work.
Qi Cheng used prototype versions of the text
in applied logic courses and
suggested improvements that made it a better book.
The authors also want to credit the students, 
numbering more than a thousand,
who applied themselves to early versions of the
text and provided their feedback. Thank you, every one.
